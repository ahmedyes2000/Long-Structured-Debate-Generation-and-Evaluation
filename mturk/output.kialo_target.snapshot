Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates problems like feelings like <unk> and thus the main reason why people can use this to learn about what can be a valuable one <EOA> Not all people are being exposed to the negative aspects of the daily population <EOA> <unk> are more important to learn about social media that may be the reason why people can see their own culture - not necessarily as good as the most important role models for a person to be exposed to a person's own identity <EOA> <unk> are not a good thing to do something that might be seen as an act of social good. For example, it is not possible to do so <EOA> It is not clear how to share the same level of value if it comes to a person's personal identity <EOA> If we don't agree that people could not learn as long as they would be considered as <unk <EOA> It is difficult to understand a person's identity and a lack of social influence if it is a person of a particular race and ethnicity than others. This argument may be made if people cannot be <unk> or even if they may want to do so <EOA> People can be held responsible for their own ideas <EOA> If we can make people make decisions about how many society they may listen to their own beliefs on what people are forced into it <EOA> It is not possible to make people with different views that promote themselves and society. People who do not understand their thoughts or beliefs are not necessarily bad.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> <unk> can make a person who wants not to be a good person for their own own <unk> <unk <EOA> People who have a good job will do not have a <unk> and thus often be willing to use their own own <unk <EOA> People who do not want to do good or otherwise lack a <unk> to their job may be a <unk> but a person who is willing to do so can be a reason for the individual to be <unk> is a reason why people who choose to spend their children do not need to be put to the same thing or have their own needs, but rather do something that may be a good person <EOA> This may be a form of the state that does not mean that they will be a good reason for that society as a whole is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> If we put money on a society where the state takes place it does not necessarily mean that it is not a good place for people who do not want to be a better life to be doing so that they will not be able to get away with it <EOA> The fact that a system has a system of education doesn't provide to the justification of an action doesn't seem to matter in a fair position of a good state or the state does not give them a responsibility to contribute to the state as a whole <EOA> This is a claim to the extent that people who do not want to do or do not do not have the ability to choose whether or not we wish to do so <EOA> The fact that a system has a duty to ensure it's a better reason to grant that government deemed to be sufficient for a system to form an argument is not made if the state does not have a direct effect on the state of the state as a whole <EOA> This does not make the state a policy that is deemed to be a right, but a state does not require citizens to remain respected, thus making policy decisions. This does not have to be one where all citizens are allowed to vote on the list <EOA> A state that is not always a state of affairs may be necessary for the state to interfere with the state, even if it is not democracies.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a high degree of attention and information from the community and thus are a good thing if you are not doing the good job if you can be <unk> to the people who can be made more in most of your own needs and may be better off if you have a role in what you feel like your family <EOA> You can be unhappy with your own friends or not believing in your <unk <EOA> No one can want to know you can work because you are never preparing for your friends to be <unk <EOA> You can be happy to have friends or a <unk> and your <unk> your partner could have their own own your family <EOA> It's too difficult to find your partner to work without your consent <EOA> You can still make your partner incredibly <unk> because you cannot use it to do so <EOA> Unless you have a responsibility to your own family, your commitment to your partner is not the same as going to your family <EOA> Your partner does not want to start an official relationship, but rather your <unk <EOA> This is not a positive way to determine whether something is worth your partner does <EOA> It's not always about your partner as you will find your partner a little and no effort to take on the partner.
TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates a high degree of <unk> and <unk> is not a good thing for <unk> and thus not a good thing <EOA> TV and sports are also beneficial for the poor and are not needed to build on a <unk <EOA> TV creates a bad environment. The most common alternative are also highly <unk> and thus the <unk> is still in a place where it is not necessarily a good thing as a good thing <EOA> You don't need to see that it is not a good reason to see it as an <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that most people do not want to be taught in your house if you have a high <unk> but you can be working to be <unk <EOA> TV can be <unk <EOA> For many people, these people are still less interested in the <unk> and thus those who do not want to spend their time in their own houses for their own <unk <EOA> <unk> is the same as having a <unk> <unk> in your own name is not an inherent role as well as <unk <EOA> <unk> is not comparable to the business of a business to make someone a job of someone who is a business, but rather a product of one's own own individual interests <EOA> The point of a <unk> to the business is not to make it a good reason to be an integral part of that community.
TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV creates a <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> which are also used in a lot of social <unk> can be <unk <EOA> You can't use the <unk> <unk> and even though it is not necessary to use it to be a business <unk <EOA> You can be <unk> in your house you need to have to be read as you know you have a <unk <EOA> It's possible to be a good thing <EOA> The person who makes a game of something does not make it a product to be <unk <EOA> You can still make your own effort to make it a <unk> to your partner and it may not be a problem <EOA> You can be read in a <unk> and if your friends will be able to get your credit for your own <unk> and a <unk <EOA> This is not necessarily a matter of security; if you take a large amount of money to your house with your friend or your family <EOA> You do not need to be <unk> or your friend or your own your family <EOA> The way you look like. You need to look at you you can give your friend you <unk>
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> People who have <unk> are a lot of work and most likely would make it more difficult to be able to make a better choice <EOA> There is no reason for this to be the best place for <unk <EOA> There are already many ways of avoiding a <unk> that can easily be found on a person's job while having a high degree of <unk> or a particular thing <EOA> This is still a problem. It is not a valid thing to take a great job to be forced into a <unk> but rather a <unk <EOA> It may be better to improve a <unk <EOA> It is not possible that people are more likely to be in the same way. It would be better to assume that even if they are better off being put on a better job than they would be more likely to choose to work for a better job to work for more than one person <EOA> The vast majority of working jobs have a great benefit to society as a whole and may be part of the system and thus most people would not have <EOA> A UBI would not prevent people from receiving a job even if this affects them in the place of an <unk> job <EOA> A UBI would not necessarily be an equally efficient solution for many groups that have a high chance of having a strong job at all. The poor will still still prefer a job to achieve this <EOA> If a UBI is not paid in a job, it is still worse off. This is not a reason to avoid a UBI.
Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> If the same goal does not make that one would not be able to use the same source for the same thing as it is needed by the same standard <EOA> It is possible to be <unk> to be a valid reason to argue that a <unk> has a strong enough reason to believe the same is true because it is the same with the same <unk <EOA> There is no such thing as a pure <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> The same argument applies to the same thing that we were made with this debate <EOA> The same argument could be made to compare all other different ways <EOA> The idea that it will be necessary to understand the logical inconsistencies of a language - it is not the same that is considered a pure invention, but rather it is a false dichotomy to say that it is <EOA> The logical inconsistencies suggests the concept of a language that defines uniformity and rights as a standard of size, have been defined as that lineage of a presupposition in good discourse <EOA> The definition of defined in this claim does not invalidate the claim that a pure <unk> doesn't say that it exists in the first place is a pure intellectual intervention. This is just an extraordinary statement that it does not exist or at all of the above. For example, the standard of evidence in terms of evidence is to be used to be false or contradictory <EOA> The argument is not that there is an intelligent concept. There is no reason to believe that each of the things things are timeless, word everywhere in which topic doesn't apply or require an increasing number of claims <EOA> To say that the statement is true is not the same as composition, \(which says clearly it should be not explicitly referenced in the claim to refute the claim called the statement \(i.e. not all unsubstantiated claims. The claim "a definition is, not a being which is called God.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> The fact that many people in the world have little value at all is not a reason to be a good thing in a society and still have no reason to make a good place in <unk <EOA> The fact that the people who live in a country do not want to be a country do not make that sense <EOA> It might still be a bad <unk> or the country as a whole and is a better place to be able to make a world with less empathy and thus a better world than other countries as well as a <unk> If it is not the best way to do so <EOA> The world has been a great feature of human history, so it's hard to imagine how they can be brought into and overcome the problems that humans are <EOA> In fact, we can change the nature of our culture. There are many examples of world fields and may well reject our own national structure without it if we can be constructed on our own <EOA> The idea of a stable state is unique to its own nation's diverse values and cultures. It is not fair to say that one of those values is a good place to share basic values <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a human <unk> to value one's own needs is not necessarily good <EOA> This argument assumes that people do not choose to be born into their country if they are not being used or accepted. It may still be true that some people share a world with free life as well as their own life as that has been argued that society has a moral obligation to fight for other people's rights <EOA> If society as a whole and a society at which society should be oppressed by all human beings and a society in itself. By contrast, they can be defined in a fair and orderly country if there is a place in society where people do not have to live in a country where they can be considered a property by any individual <EOA> <unk> and many people have been able to make good choices in society and society should be abolished.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> <unk> and a lot of work and the most expensive <unk> is a good thing to be made in the same way that a person has a lot of time to be able to make a sense with them in the way to <unk> and <unk> can make them a good place of <unk> can easily be used to have a lot of time and effort to go out by many others <EOA> The person is not their own business <EOA> There is no reason to believe that someone who is actually a good thing <EOA> If someone who does not want something to be in place of someone who is being <unk <EOA> There are examples of people who are not working on their own education, but are often not given the same level of <unk> and the same standard of living in the first place of a life long time <EOA> <unk> is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> Most of them don't have a good reason to believe that the future has no reason to do so <EOA> There are many examples of poor people who choose not to believe in a good relationship to be <unk <EOA> This is not a reason to believe in it. If we don't see the good of doing so, it is still a reason to not be wrong <EOA> This is not the case if you are a good thing. If you have a moral obligation to make one self choice, you don't have a right to a job to be a person, you may choose not to be at all.
Television is bad for people. TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV <unk> is not a good thing or <unk> but that is not a good thing <EOA> TV <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of activities that do not require the most important value to their lives and the people who have <unk> <unk> to the entire community of <unk> the way of having a <unk> to <unk> <unk> is not an <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a <unk <EOA> There are many ways to be available to them, yet those who don't want to do it are not a bad one <EOA> <unk> are not mutually exclusive <EOA> <unk> is a good thing to be considered as <unk> and the same thing <EOA> <unk> can be done in a place for <unk <EOA> <unk> can be made in a variety of ways, but it does not mean that they have been seen as such <EOA> This does not mean that they are the most important thing to be described as an <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> Those who do not want to have a stable <unk> and may not have a good <unk <EOA> This is very hard to create a stable <unk> that is not a matter of personal preference <EOA> There are many other ways to <unk> someone with a <unk> and that they can be seen to be a <unk> for the <unk> and the first place on the basis of their work of a particular <unk <EOA> <unk> are not a result of a <unk> but it may be a <unk> and the <unk> and that you do not have a responsibility to be a better place to be a good thing <EOA> The same is not true for <unk <EOA> This argument applies to all cultures who do not agree on the same level as a <unk> and the concept is not a matter of whether it is considered the case <EOA> If there are multiple sources in place that do not necessarily exist and in the case of <unk> <unk> the concept of <unk> and that are not defined or true, it does not matter if the values of society are not considered as good, but rather the same thing, but those who choose to go through the state to have a say in their own best life <EOA> The state can easily intervene when it is necessary for society to intervene in all cases, even those who are not in favor of a state or religion <EOA> The state should be forced to impose a religious framework that may be the case, for example, if a person could have a state of their own life and not their personal benefit <EOA> While a state does not necessarily equal a right. Religion rejects its applicability of an entire state of mind in the form of government or to state interference in the community.
TV causes violence & crime. <EOA> <unk> and TV use can be found to have an <unk> of their own culture and other <unk> are often seen in the hands of the American <unk> and most people live with their own culture and a culture that is a social construct to the US or other <unk> the culture of the <unk <EOA> The <unk> culture is a unique source of history <EOA> It is not the fact that it is a culture that they are oppressed by their culture - they are the reason for society as a whole <EOA> There are many examples of culture that have always been accepted as being in practice is not a reason to discriminate against others. For example, it is not necessarily a reason to call it <unk <EOA> It is not possible to be a cultural culture but it is not a good thing to do <EOA> Cultural culture and cultural appropriation as a matter of cultural values would be a different culture than it and therefore may not be the best way to solve this problem <EOA> Cultural appropriation does not make sense in the context of cultural culture as a whole, but rather the way we agree that those values are not necessarily of bad values <EOA> Cultural values are not necessarily incompatible with reality, therefore it does not necessarily make them inherently bad <EOA> Cultural appropriation makes sense in cultural appropriation because it can be considered a good thing if cultural traditions are socially constructed. This is not a matter of cultural values <EOA> Cultural values do not necessarily reflect cultural values or values. Cultural values tend to be different from cultural diversity in history.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be used for sports <unk> a person will have a better role for <unk> <unk> is not just having a bad <unk> <unk> and <unk> is an <unk> to your own <unk <EOA> There are many <unk> and <unk> that are not the most common method of <unk <EOA> There are ways to do these things <EOA> The most important point of this film is not a good thing to do and not <unk <EOA> There is no reason that art could be achieved and are not necessarily the same thing <EOA> The fact that they are not a good thing does not make it a good reason to make them a better place to make their own decisions about how much lives in the long run <EOA> The average person will not think that the time in the field is not necessarily a good thing. If people feel like it can be a place at all, they are still not allowed to make their own decisions, that is not the fault of others <EOA> It is not clear how to play a <unk> if it is a personal choice. If you want to have a voice that can be done for it <EOA> Whether or not someone is good or bad, does not make someone good. It is wrong to make someone who's reflection is good for their own actions, but they are not worth the option they are doing it <EOA> The fact that people can make an informed decision doesn't make the decision to listen to those that are committed in a service or just as much a true god.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an interesting way to learn about a particular experience of a good time <EOA> TV creates a lot of personal feelings with their own <unk> a lot of personal <unk> the person can be a good thing for the job that is not worth the need for <unk> and a person should be able to do what they want to do that thing in the most place in society, and that is not always able to do something like <unk> or the <unk> to the <unk> is a bad way to understand it not to be one of their own <unk <EOA> <unk> can be made in a stable field to make a place at the expense of a <unk> but the <unk> can do so <EOA> The concept of <unk> can be defined as the fact that a person can be unhappy with a high level of accountability. A <unk> is a different place to be able to be a good thing, and may be a good thing for the first place in the first place <EOA> This can be achieved if you can be made to be an exclusive class <EOA> In the context of the <unk> you have a strong predisposition to your own family, you choose to vote for your own <unk <EOA> There is no way to know if the time is very high and they can make a good thing or do not want a good or not <EOA> The time you have to say is a factor that must be dealt with by a single individual. You must have the ability to do anything that is so <EOA> In many countries, this is still a gross act and external crisis, and its lack of consensus should not be a valid reason to argue that if something is rational or not - that must be held accountable for it, and therefore it is not just the best option to be imprisoned <EOA> If you don't consider the <unk> you cannot be legally <unk>
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV allows people to access to TV and use in the <unk> and most of their time to the average person with many of them and thus will have a positive impact on how much they can and have the same <unk> to find a way to do that they can be <unk <EOA> Those who are most likely to be unhappy are not necessarily a good thing to do <EOA> There is a special need for educated individuals in both the workforce and their communities <EOA> The person having to do their work is a good thing and not in the best interest of the person who can act as an <unk <EOA> It seems unlikely that those who will not want their career are willing to do to work for better performance and have little value from working with their job to spend their time they work and do so with an extra job that means that they do not spend any time in which more people can make that decision when they are more <unk <EOA> This assumes that people will generally seek a job with their own jobs and decisions to be better suited to acquire and enjoy their jobs, thus anger can improve their ability to make choices made for them <EOA> This is not the case if we put it into the job, that the working class remains wealthy would be increasingly <unk> and the vast majority of people will be able to earn enough jobs when they are poor <EOA> The poor will be much more informed of the working conditions, not the job <EOA> The vast majority of people who don't want to work for jobs and enjoy a greater benefit to society <EOA> If people who actually do poor are not worth less. It is unlikely that many candidates will spend their jobs being increasingly employed. A lot of the time in 2015, a <unk> <unk> may be able to make this <unk> but rather their own jobs due to having a high chance of having a job with their own labor.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a better environment for <unk> can be better than the <unk> <unk> <unk> are not necessarily better at <unk <EOA> TV can be made to make <unk> and can easily be seen as a matter of quality <EOA> The fact that a <unk> is not an argument does not make it necessarily a good <unk <EOA> There are many other ways to build a better place of <unk <EOA> You can't do that because you are not doing so <EOA> This is still a matter of time <EOA> This is not necessarily the case, but rather to make it a better place to learn about how many people are told that their own experiences is not a good reason to believe it does not work <EOA> That is not true in the first place where it does not work and the role of the parent <unk <EOA> You can make a look like <unk> or <unk> but you can be your own business. For your own reality, your statement is not a <unk <EOA> You can just judge your child without any skill or training <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> TV provides a better understanding of a <unk> to be a social <unk> and thus often enables a lot of <unk> to use their <unk <EOA> Those who do not work are often not in good way or good to learn about the taste of <unk <EOA> There is no need for a culture of art that can be used to help them have to be <unk> to be a <unk> is a common practice in the first place in <unk> and <unk <EOA> If you are not aware of the value of a person <EOA> The fact that many people see what happens to be made to have been done in a way that was not the same as talking to the same thing <EOA> But that does not mean that they may make someone wrong or wrong, such that they are not considered <unk> or not <EOA> Not every citizen of a person who was not a good thing or could also be an <unk> for the purpose of a person's life, or even the quality of their life or the life of another person or that a person is not as intellectual or morally reprehensible as if their life is fair, it may be the best choice, but rather to see how that life is worth living, but that doesn't mean that they are in a better position to act and act in terms of being acceptable <EOA> To believe that this claim should be wrong doesn't mean that we should not treat all life for anything else, but it does not make sense to justify the existence of morality <EOA> To consider a good thing. If something directly gives a life that they might choose not to be wrong to kill them, it shouldn't matter just because it is done in the wrong of a <unk> and therefore it is not immoral to do so for a better quality of life than one not forced to do so <EOA> To the extent that killing people in the life is not necessarily the same as killing in the life of those who are not considering the life of a life who may be considered immoral and, therefore, killing the life that people who would not have life should be lives.
So are books and political opinions.  No one is forcing us to watch TV. <EOA> It is the right and freedom of movement, which the many <unk> has been able to make a good judgement of how many of the internet or the <unk> is not in the political position but to the same thing <EOA> The creation of political correctness would be the most likely a result of this <unk> to the extent of what the Internet is not subject to the general public <EOA> The fact that the internet has a free range does not negate the point in its opinion <EOA> The point of a free speech is to be a good thing and not to free speech is not an inherent right. It does not apply to social entities, but to a particular extent, but it is not the government's personal interest to stop or regulate an individual's personal views or opinion for any group to be heard <EOA> Free speech means we all may hear and see things we disagree with every day. In the United States we do not silence or remove those we disagree with, we use our free speech to oppose viewpoints we consider to be wrong <EOA> Free speech means we all may hear and see things we disagree with every day. In the United States we do not silence or remove those we disagree with, we use our free speech to oppose viewpoints we consider to be hate speech and expression that we "should" be <unk> we don't even judge what we do and what we see is not an <unk <EOA> Free speech can be a prerequisite for free speech <EOA> This argument is a slippery slope fallacy. To say in any discussion about the right to free speech is not an argument against a free speech that allows one government to change its opinion is not necessarily a free action <EOA> Free speech does not entail a right, but an argument from violating the rights of one member by definition defined by government in the first place <EOA> Free speech does not entail being entitled to a pulpit. We can't treat a hateful statement altogether.
Television is bad for people. TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> You can be a good thing to have sex with a TV <unk> <unk <EOA> The fact that people can be unhappy does not make them true <EOA> This does not mean that it has a negative impact on one's sexual activity <EOA> The study is not that a couple has a right to choose what is a person, but rather to prevent sexual abuse and sexual activity in the first place is more important than that of an <unk> <unk> and is not the case, but it does not necessarily mean that it is not a valid reason for sexual orientation <EOA> It is not clear how to review the relationship if it is to be considered the sexual desire, thus making sexual partners feel a sexual orientation. There are many sexual characteristics that have a sexual relationship <EOA> Sexual sexual sexual relationships may be justified in the sense of that sexual activity may cause depression to be incredibly triggering as the physical burden of the relationship <EOA> It is not the sexual activity that made sexual partners more likely to commit sexual partners in the sexually <unk> relationships <unk <EOA> This may be a reason for the sexual relationship to the person being made seem to be <unk <EOA> Sexual sexual orientation is not a sex act. It is a sexual orientation <EOA> There are reasons to believe that sexual intercourse is a sexual act and therefore is not as acceptable as a relationship.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> People who need a lot of sports have a lot of time and skills to use <unk <EOA> The problem should be to be the most useful ones that are being made with it <EOA> The point where there is a large difference between a person with higher level of trust is to be in place to be <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that most people would be able to do so if they do not want to work as a person will not consider it or be <unk <EOA> The same could be said for people who are not in a sports work and are often more <unk> and <unk> than most of the developed countries with <unk <EOA> The problem with this point is that many children are not going to be in a stable world, and are not working in a place in most countries, and are often more likely to be able to afford the same quality of life as one needs to be a better solution <EOA> If a person needs a job to raise family or shelter for their own family than having a job in the first place to do so is not a reason for it <EOA> A job that could be very expensive to be a good job for all children is needed to achieve a child <EOA> This is not necessarily true. Having more children in the future is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> It does not matter if a person is not able to pay for the system they do not want to be <unk> and their parents make this good by virtue of their parents to work hard but their parents have a chance to do so.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a false and artistic idea that you are being able to make people feel like what they are doing <EOA> TV creates a <unk> <unk> <unk> is an act of <unk> to be seen in <unk> and a social <unk> with a good place for your own own is not a good thing <EOA> <unk> does not solve the problem <EOA> If you take a large number of things that are not directly related to your <unk> I have to choose to do what they think to be <unk <EOA> The fact that many people do not think about what is not what they are doing is not the same thing as being able to make a good thing. There is no reason why they should not be able to choose to choose your own own <unk> or even if they don't think is not what they are doing they are not <unk <EOA> It does not matter how much you <unk <EOA> The fact that a person can be willing to have a life does not make it moral or just <EOA> Whether or not someone is being pressured into committing an act does not harm each individual or the act of doing something does not necessarily mean that you should be punished for doing so <EOA> It is not necessarily true that someone who committed a crime is not necessarily an obligation to have a life with their own life. The difference between the life and a life in that life is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> The fact that something is wrong, doesn't make it a better choice.
Television is bad for people. TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV creates a bad environment that can be a job to be a good thing <EOA> TV creates a job to avoid having a job and the time to make them feel less comfortable at <unk <EOA> <unk> people are often not working out of <unk> because they are not working to see that many people who are exposed with more work and are often better than that and not because they are not working with <unk <EOA> There are already many people who have good jobs to make an informed decision that seems to be <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe that job training would be better to just be <unk <EOA> It does not mean people will have a greater job and a good job than just those who are in need of job <unk> who are not allowed to work in their job because they are paid for more work in the first place <EOA> It is not possible to expect that job to work on a job is not necessarily more likely to suffer for job training. Having a job for society for good reason to ensure their ability to work is a better way to achieve a greater level of <unk> if a job may be more likely to be able to make a job with a poor person who is unhappy and that a job is worth it for a job <EOA> Welfare systems can be used to ensure a high level of work as they do not exist in any meaningful way <EOA> It may be better to ensure a fair work of jobs if a higher rate is not necessarily a reason to have a job to work for a job and business of a job or a job to ensure that someone who is willing to have a job <EOA> Welfare systems have a form of welfare that makes people choose to pay for their jobs. The problem is not the UBI itself.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> People who want to stay in the society should have less effort to move out of a way to <unk> a relationship could be used for other forms of <unk <EOA> People can do the same <EOA> If your partner will have <unk> people who are in fact being a better option than they are in the first place <EOA> This may be a problem in a job that is not <unk> and thus the norm will be better than having been done to work for <unk> <unk <EOA> If you have to go through their work with the most common or unique <unk> you are already forced to go through the same way of having a <unk <EOA> In the same way you can achieve that goal in a relationship with a family <EOA> It may not be possible to work out to work with a high degree of <unk> or even close relationships with different cultures who choose to do so and therefore not a good thing to do <EOA> This may be true for all couples who would have a high level of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in the first place of the relationship with the relationship <EOA> Given how a relationship will be seen as a way of creating a prenup that is considered a good thing <EOA> This would not be a reason to engage the relationship between partners in the relationship and could not be done without having to come out of it.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates negative consequences for the people who want to go to the point that they want to go as well. It is not possible to find people who want to do or do not change their mind <EOA> Not all people share this <unk> <unk> can become <unk <EOA> There are many ways to change the culture of the job of a <unk> and in fact that they can only be made to make people feel like they need to be <unk <EOA> You can still be <unk> to all forms of education that can be made for the job of a <unk> <unk <EOA> It would be better to be able to do so when it comes to a person of being able to learn their job to do so <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are the main reasons why people should not be forced to have a job to choose not to be <unk <EOA> This is not the case if the person is being able to choose to do something that doesn't mean that they're in a job they want to do so. It is not a problem <EOA> You don't need to do anything if you want to make it a job more in a place if you do not need a <unk> and your <unk <EOA> This may be a good thing <EOA> It would be better to use a lot of money to be paid to all things so the job of doing it will make the poor better job to spend money and make it better for them to get to a job if the person is willing to spend it.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be a good thing to work in a way that makes people feel like they are not a job knowing they can be <unk> to be <unk <EOA> Those who have not been exposed to a person who is often part of a career <unk> have more than a day than it is or may not be so comfortable to be subject to the same way as a way of having a career in a place to have a little time being seen as good because it is not a good thing for them because it is worth it as a job in a job that is good for them for good reasons for that job <EOA> <unk> and not just <unk <EOA> It is not always true that the job of the job becomes worth it in the first place <EOA> If a person does not want to vote then they don't know that they are worth having to pay on the work they have even to work for them in order to avoid having jobs or receiving any job they want to work for their job due to having to work for them in a job that they can do so on to work in a field <EOA> It is not clear how that would be done with the job of an employee instead of working for it <EOA> The point of this claim is that this point is not how much of a job is to serve the job, but not because of the perception that employers have a good reason to believe that those who are more willing to do this to be <unk <EOA> It is not always true that a job may be poor, or to be compensated for their job and thus take this job from someone who gets <unk <EOA> If someone doesn't make working for someone they do not want to work in the long term, they may not have done something for the job to have their job. If someone takes a life for a job, it is not worth an even need to enjoy working on a job in order to receive a job or order that at home <EOA> It is not true that who is more jobs in the economy than in the field where they do not have any incentive to work on jobs when they are <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV makes people anti-social. Popular television shows ranging from Celebrity Big Brother to Little Britain were blamed by members of the Church for eroding moral standards. <EOA> It is a false attitude to say that one is the reason that the LGBTQ+ community has to be seen as being in a <unk> and in many countries, they should be considered to be to tell the interpretation <EOA> This is a very small difference between the gay and two politically poor. In the case of the LGBTQ+ <unk> the same gender identity may be seen as being the same as being LGBTQ+ than the gender binary <EOA> The gender identity is not an issue in the society who is being transgender is a false dichotomy. It may be a good thing for the gender of the biological concept of gender as a social construct <EOA> This is a very small and subjective context in how trans people come about. This makes sense in this context to say that gender is not an inherent trait that becomes universal with gender stereotypes and gender stereotypes and it is not a good thing for the gender of a biological person, even if they would agree to a gender identity <EOA> This may be a good thing. It may be a problem for some people, but a form of gender - such as gender identity <EOA> There is no evidence of this or even any other group as trans because some may be attractive to some individuals <EOA> If we were to support the existence of gender there will be no such thing as fixed rights. If we see that people are being discriminated against <EOA> The same argument could be made for gender non-conforming people in the same way it does not take the same attention to women <EOA> This may be true, but that does not mean the gender they have not sex, or even fixed as well as gender identity doesn't guarantee the race of gender as a social construct <EOA> There are examples of trans people who have gender biases, that mean a woman having to have gender identity and gender are not mutually exclusive. A person's gender is not worth birth.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an <unk> and makes a lot of people who are less likely to have a positive impact on what people have a good job <unk <EOA> People will be unable to do so when they make bad decisions or make these options <EOA> It is not a valid argument to make decisions based on how many people in the world or for this group or not. This is not necessarily a reason to believe in it <EOA> For many people, people don't have this reason to believe that they should be treated as such <EOA> People who are motivated to believe people are more likely to be concerned about how they see that they choose to believe in a better relationship with the environment <EOA> There is no reason to believe that this would be a major reason to believe that one may choose not to believe in it <EOA> There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to believe in it <EOA> Believing in something doesn't make you true. Most people believe you are able to believe in it. If you don't know what you don't see if you don't believe in my opinion or how you do something you should not be able to believe that belief will not be true <EOA> The vast majority of people are agnostic about how many people get incorrect or incorrect decisions to be made. Like this perspective, there are plenty of reasons why people do not believe prayer is incorrect and illogical and yet also believe it <EOA> Believing in something causes not to be a God or not is a better reason for why you believe that one may be able to make good choices.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a bad environment for many people that would be too high for them, and can still be seen as being more <unk <EOA> The study in question is about how many people become less <unk> in society are unlikely to be a reason to work in <unk <EOA> The study is very much more it than those who do not work in most countries, so they would be much more likely to be a good <unk <EOA> In order to make the job more <unk <EOA> The fact that many people do not believe that they do not do this by virtue of having their own needs <EOA> There is not necessarily a good thing for having kids because of a high income or lack of education or education but rather a positive relationship with many people in the world <EOA> This argument seems to be valid only when you don't want to be <unk> but it does not make people more comfortable with good education <EOA> That doesn't mean that a single person is not enough to be a good thing <EOA> If one would argue that the <unk> has a positive effect on the life of those who should be forced to get their own education <EOA> This argument would be true in any way, as we have no reason to believe it is not correct to say we should take the least worth it now.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be used to make people feel like they can be exposed to other forms of communication for <unk <EOA> There are also ways to learn how much <unk> is a matter of learning how it can be used to learn to see how much one can be used. For example, many are <unk> and can be done because they are a social norm that can be used to be a good thing for others <EOA> It is not necessarily true that most people would be willing to do the job at that time <EOA> It is not necessarily true to be a good thing <EOA> This argument could be used to support those who are already being discriminated against by a person who has never been given to it, or in fact work in some <unk <EOA> Those who are already asked to have any kind of reason so they should be able to make decisions without a position of authority should be subject to the same standard <EOA> The <unk> of the system is that it will be made as a tool for creating a more <unk> approach of <unk <EOA> It is not always true. For example, the person of the poor is unlikely to be able to understand the decisions in that particular candidate will be represented as well as the poor or even lower performance or other factors to improve the quality of life of those who have been selected to earn their own <unk> the amount of time and time is paid for by the poor and disadvantaged to one of the highest characteristics of the public and the average person will be willing to work to get the same vote <EOA> It should not be the standard that citizens have to inform themselves to the profit, but that the benefit is not ultimately the most. For example, this has been in huge interest in many countries, even when the average average person has been college graduates to get the same with them in the first place <EOA> A few people in this field have college students with low socio-economic performance at low income families and managers who are less likely to receive training from family members when poor people are more likely to attend <unk> for example, are less likely to be employed in a high level of cognitive thinking.
Television is bad for people. TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV creates a great degree of personal information to be <unk <EOA> TV and online are not required to make decisions that they are not always subject themselves <EOA> TV provides people with limited information about their own personal information and <unk> and they are not subject to <unk> or even if they are in a better position to take place with their ability to do so <EOA> <unk> of <unk> can be made by the <unk> and <unk> and therefore cannot be considered a better actor in <unk <EOA> There is a difference between <unk> and <unk> <unk> and that you cannot know what is the correct <unk <EOA> There is no such thing as <unk> or <unk> <unk <EOA> The point of being a product is not the same as making art but that doesn't mean they are the good or most of those learning needs. For example, <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> or <unk <EOA> People who have been asked about their own <unk <EOA> The same could be said of art to do not have a good or good experience <EOA> The person who is being consumed is not a good reason to do something doesn't make that thing are.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can do something it can help them to make a better <unk> to use the way to make <unk> is not an important thing to be the best a way to see that it is not a good thing if you are being able to make a lot of people who will be able to see that most people who can make up for it, even though it can be taught that you are not able to make your own decisions <EOA> You don't seem to have a social one. For example, your <unk> <unk> is a way that you can learn your own needs. <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not being made to be a good thing <EOA> This is a false dichotomy. It is not the point that you can be forced to go to heaven <EOA> No matter how much you tell you about your appearance you are not being forced to do something you do not want to know your <unk <EOA> You can be expected to be a <unk> you need a <unk> but you do not make your choice <EOA> No one has a right to do something that affects them in any circumstances. This is not the case if you are able to see the reality in a particular way, but you have an obligation to make that choice at all <EOA> I don't think that you want your child to be <unk> and your partner will never want to be your own partner if you are forced to have their own body <EOA> People cannot be harmed without knowing it or knowing or not <EOA> You can still know if you choose not to use your child with your own own your body.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a lot more complicated to those who do so by having children do not make people <unk> are often less likely to be in the same way that they do not need them, as they do not make the source of a positive change - the idea of having a <unk> is a way to make things less likely to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a matter of how people need to choose to make them feel like something they are being exposed to their mental health and may be a good thing for their job <EOA> There is a lot of public <unk> which leads to depression and the mental health problems caused by medical <unk> <unk> and the health problems caused by the <unk> is still a high level of sexual health <EOA> This assumes that the majority of people do not believe that they should be treated as sexual <unk> in the US, which is not true for most people <EOA> The fact that even in a study has shown that sexual abuse causes lower recidivism rates in the public are lower than most studies show that this study only acknowledges that teen pregnancies are lower drastically due to lower level levels resulting in negative health effects <EOA> The study was based on the study of the data that lists the overall impact of the data collected - from the sample size of the clinical <unk> and the results of the study in varying sample numbers contradict the rise of the number of lower academic use. The data on the source is not the opposite <EOA> These findings are based on evidence that only results are changing. The number may be the FBI, but the data is not from theories that may be negative or are positive to the data from those results would be misleading or misleading if not even the data from the data is not the same as evidence <EOA> The data from lower studies is expected to have no correlation with the validity of this data question. The scientific evidence is to reduce the data provided by the data about the data on the data from the data claim is the data being made into account the climate vary indicate that all forms of climate change are not causation is due to the study at the results provided by the data is identifying in the context of the data written - the results in the results are irrelevant <EOA> data about data testing is not evidence that the results are not known. It is research that results in the study are misleading and unfounded <EOA> The data is not to research that the data should lay from data on it to data with data from <unk> it is not the data or research to concluded that the data is false or misleading argument <EOA> The data does not prove that research studies are carried out on specific medications made some data to prove that the data cannot study claims to be based on something that results in no negative results or failure to do so.
TV unites people. <EOA> TV has been used to support a high level of trust and <unk <EOA> The <unk> is not necessarily a good thing that can put a job at a <unk <EOA> <unk> and other forms of <unk> has been shown to be a good thing as <unk> and even to a <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> can be made from TV <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no need for a second job to <unk> in order to be able to be a <unk> <unk <EOA> The fact that a person can make a job does not mean that they don't want to get into a football <unk <EOA> It may be better to be a job without buying for the sport or to use it <EOA> This is an argument against a <unk> <unk> and the absence of <unk> and <unk> is a matter of <unk <EOA> There are many other forms of <unk> which are not given the option to engage with a <unk <EOA> The public may not want to do this for their own needs.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> There are many other ways to improve the quality of society that do the same for many people in society, but that doesn't mean it's a good thing or how that is a valuable thing <EOA> This argument has a negative impact on society <EOA> People who do not understand the society in society would be not the same thing as <unk <EOA> Society shouldn't be able to grow better of society for better quality of life, rather than a social construct. In fact, a society may be more efficient at <unk> or just a small portion of a society that does not come to be better off <EOA> The fact that people who choose to spend their lives may not be for a better quality of their own lifestyle would be better achieved because of the poor people will spend effort on their family and thus start at a disadvantage to the environment and their own choices and choices <EOA> It is not necessarily bad to justify fulfilling one's own lifestyle choices, while in a scenario where the work is too subjective to be zero <EOA> In many cases, UBI is not a matter of choice, but a matter of social control and not — so many people in the world are in need of free will <EOA> If the person is forced to pay for the service they can. If they pay for it they would not have to be offered and looking for their job <EOA> People would be unable to make things without providing on goods such as someone who provides things which are not satisfying or do not have the same money <EOA> People would be unable to make things like receiving welfare. They would likely not exist in a community where everyone would be given for the same time.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be made on ways which make it impossible to know how many TV are in fact bad or bad <unk> can make them more vulnerable to <unk> can be <unk> to use it to be a great deal of sexual <unk> the same way that they might not have been able to be an act of being a problem <EOA> TV offers a lot with bad results. If you remove your business you are going to make your own <unk <EOA> TV ads are often not known for ads in the first place <EOA> The ads are also highly distracting as you can afford to see if it is necessary to look at it <EOA> <unk> in your book is still considered a sign of positive moral experience <EOA> <unk> ad blockers are not anonymous anymore <EOA> The point of blocking ads is to make an ad hominem blockers \(i.e. whom they are not being lured much more and more ad blockers are unlikely to make more positive decisions <EOA> It is not about producing ad blockers but an activity that is actually user ad <unk <EOA> <unk> ads in some cases, usually cause ads to go to online areas which can be used for ad blockers <EOA> If ads are harmful and ad block public ads, they can make use of ad-blocker make content more convenient for companies to make ads more prevalent.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be a good thing for having a positive influence and may not be a good thing but it is a better thing to learn how to work is a good thing <EOA> If people do not have good enough to make an informed choice, they will be more likely to choose what they want to do with their <unk <EOA> <unk> can be considered a good thing for many people in the future <EOA> <unk> may not be able to make decisions in their own choices <EOA> It is difficult to know a point where people do not have to be <unk> to choose to do something that they will not understand that good behavior are not necessarily good or morally relevant to your opinion <EOA> If you have <unk> you may do not necessarily have to decide if it is not moral or immoral to be <unk> in your future <EOA> If the decisions are done via a certain point of view, you should be allowed to make a moral choice, even if it is not the case <EOA> It's not the best way to judge someone if you choose to, but rather you do not have a moral responsibility to make your own choices. I don't want to make you choices. I am not choosing it to decide if you were your own moral choice, but that does not make it a moral responsibility <EOA> People don't know what always wants to know about what they want. If you have a moral choice, but that doesn't mean you should be forced to do something you don't want for your child to not have a moral obligation to make your own moral decisions if we take one person in a one or another, I would still have a moral obligation to make a moral moral good, because if you can afford to do so if you choose my house, I would be forced to act on your family, if I am not <EOA> If you have to decide what is right or wrong in your own own your property or you have the choice to act on others.
Television is bad for people. TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> which may be better for the public and not to be subject to other people in place to find ways to learn and <unk> to the public and a lot of <unk> is no reason for the most important role to the point of being a good or a good thing <EOA> The value of a good job will be the best way to ensure the poor needs to be subject to the same quality of the world <EOA> It is not clear how the job of a job is the one who has the highest responsibility for the poor to be <unk <EOA> It is not clear how those who are not who are disadvantaged may be given a job or the job they feel they are still in the job position of the job being done with the job <EOA> It may be difficult to avoid this as a service when it is necessary, and it does not make sense to compare this to the job of the public <EOA> It is immoral to force individuals to help others do not work because of an event when they feel pressured by having a job to do whatever they want to do <EOA> It may be the case that a rich community may be able to provide for a job to support those who are in the workforce <EOA> This is a reason to continue improving ways that individuals do not want to be working in their home countries <EOA> If society as a whole then people can be forced to work through social structures or even relationships that are in the way we put forward their relationship into society, even if we can do nothing to solve the problem <EOA> For many, the difference between society and a society does not necessarily have to be a mere job of any job or individual that is deemed bad. Any job is worth more than a job of a job than any other citizen, but it is not. It may be the fault of the person who may choose to contribute to a better job because the amount of money we should want to spend your job on an old job, but we still don't need to work to help a child.
Television is bad for people. Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> It is better to be <unk> to be able to use the <unk> to see what you can be willing to be to be able to do this if you can make that <unk <EOA> There are many ways to understand this problem. It should be a way for that person to be <unk <EOA> <unk> can be used as a way to be a good thing to be used for <unk <EOA> The source does not require a <unk> or good because it is a matter of a point where it is <unk> but not necessarily the best way to ensure that a person is subject to a specific way of doing so <EOA> It is not a matter of what it is <EOA> You don't have the knowledge or information about what you have a <unk> is not a reason for an individual's business <EOA> You can be reading about the <unk> to be a <unk> but rather a <unk> is a positive way of achieving something that is not true <EOA> If you are using a piece of fiction that is not the most important thing to do <EOA> If it were you as a source of income for someone you can. And you could not be <unk> of you in the case, if you don't have this reason for you to be able to be a positive source of knowledge <EOA> The amount of people who <unk> is not to be <unk> or to see the value of a person's time to work on the one you make to make the goods and services more frequently on the topic in question.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> High classes on TV can be made of working with <unk <EOA> TV creates a high level of TV training in many countries where people have a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk <EOA> TV can be used as a form of <unk> to build a place to <unk> and thus a better quality of <unk> can be used for sports to be subject to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> TV can lead to <unk> or even use of the <unk> to make that sense in a culture like <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> TV and sports involve sports may not be the best possible job for younger students <EOA> <unk> is also a way of <unk> and <unk> that are not necessarily a good thing <EOA> Those who want to learn their partners or do not do something is not in need and to use the <unk> to build their own <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> can be a <unk> in a way that is a good thing when they can be used to do something that might be a good thing and do not have the same purpose <EOA> <unk> is a problem not having a place to be <unk <EOA> Those with a large variety of games do not make a place for a <unk> in the first place and a lot of people in the field is much easier as well yet that does not make it a reason for them to be comfortable with a <unk> that they have to be able to make a sense for their family.
TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> TV creates a better <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> The fact that a drug itself is a better thing in their family or <unk> <unk <EOA> The fact that it would be a reason for <unk> that is done in a bad way does not make it <unk> and even the same way that is not the same thing as having a positive role in the <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> The study of these studies is that a lot of people are likely to be more similar to the average person than that of their lifetime <EOA> The most likely source of this study does not mean that the most likely people may be <unk> or the same with this - the same source in the same case, the effect of this study is still the highest level of training in this field has not yet been linked to higher standards of <unk <EOA> The study also states that the experiment is not the most common or long-term research to suggest that this study has not been measured in any claim about the data from study conducted to <unk> to <unk> study found that the data is not that the study found that <unk> <unk> study found that other studies have found some bias, amongst the most sample found to be lower compared to other results <EOA> The study also included many police brutality against suspected pharmaceutical companies, including drug <unk> which is not the most serious representative. On the other hand, the data may be the same in the police - the study is still in the hands of the accused - not to the study, or to reduce the numbers of data rather than proving the opposite <EOA> The study quoted is about <unk> data that has occurred in a lower number of data points with data that compares the correlation coefficient both in and of cases the results is based on a sample in lower proportion of the data that suspected data collection is usually relatively diverse with the sample most rarely combined data points on the existence of the data from review it is clear that the results in similar, arguments from the observable correlation between the study and the results of false reviews are rarely <unk> to be the results of <unk> <unk> et al. <unk> Research estimates how the data was gathered in favor of these data <unk <EOA> The data from lower studies is not low enough to prove the conclusion itself <EOA> The evidence points to a low probability that a multitude of descriptions are in no way a rebuttal can be claimed to have witnessed the speed of false rational slaughter that are relevant to this, but neither cannot be expected. The alternative is that, with more data related to capital evidence, and the changes are unlikely to be considered <EOA> The data does not indicate that a report is false or limited from the data presented. The data is conservative to the data from surveys that compares racist data from the data is not the same as being the data used by the data from research that is conducted with research that compares conclusions from the data about data collection - research - for example, the results in articles being taken out by individuals who report in the study and research which links the results of the data from statistical research as the results of academic research results in no article.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV makes people less likely to feel uncomfortable with the most likely person with a high level of trust to the <unk> or most likely to be able to make better decisions and make them feel better than a way of getting a happy life <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are often very different for their own own <unk> rather than being a good person <EOA> There is no reason why people who do not feel comfortable or have this behaviour often choose not to be attracted from their own partner <EOA> The vast majority of individuals will be able to make bad decisions if they are more comfortable <unk <EOA> It is better to do something wrong and therefore less likely to be one of the main reasons children need to endure it <EOA> The fact that we can see that we should have a good reason for them to do so <EOA> There is no reason to believe that those experiences are bad things <EOA> This assumes that those experiences are no better than any other known situation <EOA> There is no reason why we should not grant kids life of an abusive relationship with the same knowledge as being a life that is getting better or more <unk> not a reason to believe that one is the reason to make decisions that harm others, like a better life is not necessarily better than a life at all <EOA> This is not necessarily a bad thing. Having a positive judgement to one's own experiences is hardly an option if we do not have a positive impact on your life as well as it is not worth the time and money we do so for a better reason to believe that one will not be able to make a rational one.
TV can relieve loneliness. <EOA> TV has been used to make <unk> and even less likely to feel like they have been <unk <EOA> The fact that TV can be used to make people like TV creates a bad job for that good or not to do so <EOA> It is better to see these aspects than a way for the job to do so by making good people more <unk> is good enough to know if someone is getting the most common and powerful actor has a lot of time <EOA> TV is not a reason to make that game a job that is not available. It is not the need to make a place that is not used for it <EOA> TV provides a better <unk> to make <unk> and <unk> <unk> or otherwise <unk> is a good thing <EOA> TV creates a lot for a person in a way that allows them to do something you want to do <EOA> It is not clear how to share the same quality of life for many others. It is a <unk> and most powerful and valuable job even with their job to work in order to avoid the social stigma in other parts of the world. <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> are the highest class of <unk <EOA> The average person is not working for having a job while they are paid to just because they are paid for by the same <unk> they have a very strong social class <EOA> There is no reason to assume that job would have a good job even in the first place <EOA> Politicians who are working to spend a lot of time do not have to be paid for a job.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> It is not the most important role in the <unk> to use it to be a good place to learn that it is not a good thing or that it will be a lot of time <EOA> It is a positive way to compare a number of other ways for people to become <unk> and are not the same thing as being able to do something in the field with many other ways than the <unk> <unk <EOA> This is a problem with how many people are trying to see it as more people who do not spend their hours on their own needs <EOA> It is not a valid point of view, if people believe that the majority of people feel that it is a positive relationship to the community to be subject to the same standard in a better way for people who are in a position to make sure they are not working for the environment <EOA> Many people would be forced to spend a time on the days or for the business and may not be able to make it a good <unk <EOA> People do not have to worry about what is going on and if their people want to do so. To try to do this, there can be a good reason to do this for those who are better at doing this in order to do so <EOA> If someone is willing to pay for it, they do not care about their life they will be forced to work with them <EOA> People in many industries need to spend their products on a social benefit, but it is the goal of those who feel like they are able to do so and be working for their job since they have no need for anyone to achieve the first job performance <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person working a job is playing a job without receiving an <unk> who are often paid for by the law, thus forcing a feeling of pride can be perceived as the primary worth of a job. If a person does not have to pay for a job. If their job offers a service to someone who may have the money to earn their job <EOA> It is not just how a job person doesn't want, because they want the service to be paid.
Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> It is not clear to say that the person is being charged with the other way the viewer is <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that the victim may be against the treatment of the victim. In this case, it is not the same thing as being transgender in the first place <EOA> The reason why trans individuals might not be treated as the norm that trans people are in the situation is precisely because they are the only people who believe in such an acceptance would be immoral <EOA> It is not possible to believe in an afterlife to justify that being the case, even if it is not protected under this discussion, or not to judge that person as something else <EOA> There is no reason why humans should be given a person's faith in a particular manner in which they consider or how many people make their own informed decisions, are in no way an argument against transgender people or even the same group they consider acceptable reasons in any group of people who aren't interacting with them and/or simply being vocal or punished for their own actions <EOA> There is nothing in all cases where individuals have no say in how they have an abortion <EOA> <unk> is a matter of opinion, not a fallacy <EOA> It would be better to assume that some people would have trans rights, but rather would therefore be discriminatory against the same group as those within the community <EOA> It may not be true that people are more likely to choose to engage in different activities that may be detrimental to them in a positive way <EOA> This argument assumes that the person is unable to determine what is going wrong or not. It is wrong to argue that if the law should be treated as part of an illegitimate act of what may be wrong for the individual or society of a group as the reason why this may be wrong, then the state should be protected in the way a different individual.
This is likely correlated with excessive use of TV; in moderation, it presents no such harms. <EOA> The idea that human beings are a good and human being is one of the major problems in nature of human life, not to be a human. If humans choose to use a certain range of things, this does not mean we should be a good place to eat them <EOA> The idea of a feeling of <unk> is not a valid reason to argue that it is not possible for humans to survive on the same level and have a capacity to do so <EOA> The idea of a spectrum of evolution is different from different cultures and cultures and cultures which have been able to use the same species as humans and human beings, and are a group of animals, not all humans and their own identity <EOA> Different people who have been conditioned to be selected in societies that have a negative impact on human <unk> are not the only species that can be identified as species. For example, humans can be valued in their <unk> and humans have been born with them, the fact that humans can be considered as different as humans can do their job <EOA> Different human beings are not valued above humans and thus have a very high cognitive success at all, since we support the existence of non-human creatures that are not a central part of their identity <EOA> Humans have different value than humans. If humans are capable of adapting to it, we don't treat them as good or bad <EOA> The fact that humans have evolved to do something does not make it moral to do so <EOA> If humans have a capacity for understanding and abstract and functional way to express their values and behavior on their own bodies. There is no reason to believe that those values have a positive impact on how humans value society over the world <EOA> Human societies have the value to a consumer society at all, so it is not a reason to not do so <EOA> Humans must value many value as long as their lives are made by their humans. For example, it may be hard to confirm how much it is made in one way.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV provides a problem with a TV <unk> <unk> and a way to learn the way people are doing something just because they are more likely for their actions <EOA> TV can be a tool for many individuals <EOA> TV could be made with a better actor who cannot be forced into a <unk <EOA> TV <unk> and <unk> are not the norm that people are subject to <unk <EOA> The <unk> <unk> is not what is being <unk <EOA> <unk> are not mutually exclusive <EOA> TV and sports are often a better place for people in their own lives <EOA> They are not a good reason for doing something for the first time <EOA> It is not clear why that film <unk> can be <unk> if they can be done with <unk> or <unk <EOA> It is the responsibility of the viewer to make a game that are required to use the art and the <unk> is the act of making art <unk>
TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> TV can be made in the first place and most of the people will be <unk <EOA> Having little money becomes less important as it is not the most expensive option when it comes to a particular job <unk> the average person will not get to be in the most common <unk> and many people who have a high <unk <EOA> The high cost of <unk> are the cost needed to pay the price for their job <EOA> The average <unk> is not just that you don't want to spend on the time they pay for their <unk> and that you can find a better job to buy and spend a week on the job market <EOA> You can be forced to have a job to do so <EOA> A <unk> system is not a good reason for doing something like the most important job for the sake of <unk> It is not the same or given to the system <EOA> The same is true in most countries, but the average job is paid for by the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk <EOA> There are also many factors that are not applied to all citizens, but the people that are not paid the job and most people who are <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and most of their money can be a good thing unless they are not required to do so. <unk <EOA> It is not fair to say that if the benefits of a politician who are paid for by an average worker in the work system <EOA> This does not necessarily indicate that the rich will be able to earn more than their job performance in business <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a better way than someone who is a good <unk> and the need for a <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are different from a <unk> and <unk> that are not in a way of learning and how many children do not <EOA> The same way we put on TV on <unk <EOA> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and the <unk> can be used to learn from the same logic, as to what is done in it. The most major aspects of <unk> the <unk> is a way to do the <unk <EOA> The point is that <unk> to be a matter of time it should be taught in the same way <EOA> It is not necessarily true that <unk> to make your own own <unk <EOA> There are many other <unk> that are a good thing for every person for an <unk <EOA> It is not about how many people will be told to work that the person is willing to <unk <EOA> The point of being a person is not that they have the highest level of trust in the community that is not to be that the person has no interest in doing so in a manner that makes it difficult or more difficult to build on the basis of a <unk <EOA> This argument would be true.
Television is bad for people. TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV could be used to use a <unk> and <unk> the people can be seen as bad or bad for the <unk> of the <unk> is a great <unk> to be <unk <EOA> There are many <unk> and <unk> <unk> which has not been <unk> in the same way that they have been <unk> or <unk <EOA> The same is not true for most of <unk> <unk> and <unk> are often very difficult to make things like TV and <unk <EOA> <unk> can still be made of people to use the art in which they do not want to work as well <EOA> The purpose of a <unk> to the <unk> is to be the case in many countries, which is to be the only thing that works with what you have to do <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person has a good thing but may not be true <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person can be unhappy with being <unk> and <unk> or other things that can be done for good or wrong <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not mutually exclusive. I have to tell you how to go to it, and you don't need to have a child to your job to learn about your own your hand in your hand with your own personal experience <EOA> This is not the case. Someone who is looking at the person who they are, but you have been asked on the wrong version of the system <EOA> This is not necessarily an argument against football clubs. It is just as reasonable to assume that someone who is not a person who is not the sole reason to make them look bad at an old stage, and rather being seen as good or bad for their job.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates problems with bad <unk> <unk> and <unk> which can be a good thing <EOA> <unk> of sports is a way that people can be <unk> <unk> and <unk> are not a point of view in the way to <unk <EOA> The same thing could be made for people who are socially constructed and thus in a sense of <unk <EOA> The <unk> is not a valid argument for creating a <unk> or <unk> and the same thing can be said to have no place in the first way <EOA> It is not possible to compare the <unk <EOA> There is no reason why a <unk> of <unk> is a <unk <EOA> There is also a <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily an argument that if something is considered good or bad <EOA> There are many different things that are not in the world <EOA> This is not a good thing for <unk>
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV can be used as good as the business model of the <unk> <unk <EOA> TV creates a <unk> <unk> which makes it less likely to be able to be <unk> and thus it may have been a good thing to be used as a means to make a good <unk <EOA> Some artists feel like they have a lot of time and time to be told that they are not in their own body <EOA> <unk> is not a <unk> but it has been argued that <unk> and even though it is not necessarily <unk> <unk <EOA> There are many other forms of TV that are not yet defined by the source of <unk> <unk> and are also defined as the primary source of porn and art that are subject to <unk <EOA> The fact that the art is not the best thing to be practiced is not an irrelevant argument <EOA> Not all art in the BDSM community are subject to a core interpretation of culture, which makes it subject to reality <EOA> The BDSM community has not been used for a specific culture and function as a whole. There are many aspects of BDSM that do not follow the same standards as the same thing as art that are considered art <EOA> <unk> can be considered art without a fact <EOA> There are many art sets the books that we can use to make a <unk>
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> There are many other ways to learn about the negative attitudes that could be <unk> and the <unk> is an integral part of <unk> <unk> and the same way the <unk> is <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> and the idea that the <unk> has been in history of the world to be <unk> and a better place in a <unk> or otherwise we should be allowed to make it much easier to make a sense of <unk <EOA> There are many ways to be able to make a difference if we don't know what is what is nor does it mean it's a matter of time and time in the <unk <EOA> This is not a matter of personal preference <EOA> If you look for the sake of the matter that it may be considered as a reason to believe that you can be <unk> in some cases, you can find a way to learn that you will not have to have a <unk <EOA> This is a valid reason to believe in a particular piece of time and depends on what is not a valid reason to halt it <EOA> If the person cannot be completely <unk> then it cannot be assumed without any proof <EOA> This is not necessarily an argument for value or a belief on it is not a reason to believe in the opposite. It is not the case <EOA> I don't believe in this argument but I don't believe it is true <EOA> Believing that you can make a claim about whether a person is required or not.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a better environment for many people who may not use this <unk> to see that <unk> is a very high degree of <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a <unk> and most of those who are <unk <EOA> There is no way to make a <unk> can make a look like a <unk> and the way to learn from a <unk <EOA> There are many examples to learn how to deal with the most important ones <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are also the same as being seen as the most important source for the sake of <unk> as well as those who are being <unk <EOA> Some people are in a service to others <EOA> While this may be true, it seems still a problem for the job of a person to be on the job, that we have to be able to learn to be <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> have been a matter of time, but rather to provide a good job to work if it provides good <unk <EOA> Those who are able to do so to be better than being forced to work with a career in a job they are not required to do so. This means that a UBI can be seen as having a job with a <unk> <unk <EOA> Many people have different needs to be offered through a welfare system, and are still able to vote on the job of the family.
TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV <unk <EOA> TV has been found to be an integral part of the culture of many <unk <EOA> The development of TV has been used in a variety of different cultures including the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> has been used to be the most important issue that many people who have a young character who has made many forms of sexual activity. <unk> can be seen as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> The same is not true for women in the first place and also have <unk <EOA> <unk> is a good argument for how many people to be assigned in a traditional position in order to avoid an accurate representation of gender roles or <unk <EOA> <unk> and gender are not mutually exclusive. To be a gender in society in some way, and in fact that men are not able to change and are not necessarily a problem <EOA> The gender imbalance is not the same as gender identity. It is not clear why gender roles seem to be more than the number of gendered bathrooms in gender and gender roles <EOA> The differences between gender and gender identity are not the result of differences between gender and gender equality <EOA> While there may be differences between gendered differences in gender roles in gender equality between men and women - in fact, the gender gap between biology and <unk> is a factor of gender roles as the result of gendered gender differences between biological factors are in relation to gender or biological issues <EOA> The gender imbalance between male and female is a fixed range by between the gender and the spectrum.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> <unk> in <unk> may mean that the <unk> are often a lot of <unk> and many people who live in a country that is not a major problem <EOA> The same source is not the same thing as <unk> but that is not <unk <EOA> A <unk> has never been the most important thing for the person to go out in terms of the same thing <EOA> There is a high level of <unk> in most European countries where most people are able to do with their homes at a time to be <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that the number of people in poverty is caused by many people in the world and is in a position to be a good thing <EOA> It is not necessarily the fact that people who take out all of their income are being employed in their status as well as in the US and therefore have been given to them who have been working for them and are therefore not worth it as well <EOA> The US is not at least in terms of total number of countries where the US is not economically stable as the USA has a net negative impact on the world <EOA> That is not the point in this case. The US is a far smaller and poor with high income countries and the US in the United Nations that are not the only nations that have had the largest refugee crisis, and it was not in favor of the US alone <EOA> Whether the US should or shouldn't do, does not mean that it is in the economic interest of the country that help the US is a good job of many other countries. That does not mean that any of those who are motivated by economic policies is a strong obligation to be economically fair, but a strong measure of the status quo does not in fact help the country at the expense of the country in which it is impossible for it to happen to be a very powerful and powerful quarter of the population in an area and has been called into question, for all the time, therefore those people have been the case for the United Nations - not every single country or any other country outside of the US as a whole <EOA> The US has a high income and high income countries which have historically been approximately <unk>
TV causes violence & crime. <EOA> <unk> and sports is often seen as <unk <EOA> It is not clear that most sports and people who wish to use their own source are not in need to be subject to this <EOA> It can be used to make a difference in a game that should be made as they do so to their own <unk <EOA> Most people do not use sports and are not a good reason to keep them out of the street for doing so if they can be banned or <unk <EOA> The <unk> is not an issue of <unk> It can be a form of <unk> in the case of a particular sport or even the same <unk> is not the only way it is to use a sport or a high level of <unk> but it has been argued that the first person is able to carry the highest level of <unk> which has been used to cause a high level of trust in the first place to be subject to the same problem <EOA> In many countries, there is no reason to be a piece of street service or service for every citizen who is in a place of high space <EOA> The fact that many countries do not have a service does not make it right. They do not apply the same standards as any citizen would be required to keep them out of harm's spaces. In fact, they are not allowed to do so <EOA> This is an argument for the policy that citizens have a duty to protect that state, and so should not be done in any way <EOA> In the USA there is no reason that to choose to enter into an area that is a separate issue than having a single shooting would be considered as an excuse for having a place in the first place in the first place <EOA> The US is not at home, it is not the government's place to protect citizens' rights rather than its citizens' life.
Television is bad for people. TV causes violence & crime. <EOA> It is not acceptable to see the point of violence against the most important sources of an <unk> and can be seen as a reason to use an appropriate response to the culture or even without a <unk <EOA> It is not possible to create an expression of violence <EOA> It is not acceptable to say that it is not an acceptable standard. It's a good thing to be wrong and should not be allowed to make an acceptable statement about the culture of <unk> and the culture of violence against others <EOA> It has been argued that the culture of violence is not a reason to not be wrong <EOA> It is not clear that an individual will be killed to protect it from society in a culture to defend itself against other groups <EOA> It is not the same as hate speech and violence in general. Whether it is a moral argument to ensure it is not true or not is not an acceptable argument <EOA> If we are able to defend our moral rights in order to protect others, we should protect our liberty for everyone <EOA> Hate speech is wrong, but it is not a slippery slope argument as it is <EOA> If we don't define what is, we can be forced to kill us we shouldn't be able to make a moral framework against which speech is not acceptable to those who don't want to be granted or applied <EOA> Hate speech is not a matter of free speech.
TV unites people. <EOA> TV creates a false <unk> to learn from <unk> and most people are not to learn from your own needs to be a good thing and that people have different needs and therefore do not have to choose to be <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not a good thing because it is a good thing to do with your own <unk <EOA> There is a strong correlation between <unk> and <unk> which is a very broad range of studies, including the same as <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> There are also many different aspects of a shared sense of <unk> or <unk> but it is not a good thing for <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person is not being able to do something in a different way <EOA> It is not the most expensive <unk> to be the ones whose role must be made to make it a sense of how a society can be made in the realm of how that individual is <EOA> The point is not to make a person who is being attracted to their <unk> it is not clear if you have a social choice, it cannot be said to be one that is not true <EOA> It is also not a matter of what is being said to be one or not. It is possible to say that they should be considered a crime <EOA> You can be denying a particular kind of true <unk> but you can be asked to change what is considered a crime. To say it is not wrong, it is not a valid reason to be one where your own is true <EOA> You can be abusing a crime if you have a social authority to agree that it is wrong to say it is not an recognised as an individual and an individual, not an individual's own beliefs.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a great degree to focus on social problems, rather than lack of <unk> the person who makes them bad for them is better for them with a better understanding of what is being exposed to the <unk> is the most important thing they feel to be wrong in a way that is not being put with a <unk> of their own personal information to be <unk> and <unk> and that they will not work if they are not in the same way that they will not want to work with others <EOA> <unk> can be considered as good to be offered to those that are not <unk <EOA> They may be treated as well as their primary job for society to <unk <EOA> It will be easier for a community to spend on many of their job than it doesn't work if it comes to everyone else <EOA> The fact that a few people will understand what is not good for a good or future job does not make it good or bad, particularly if you don't see how much of it may be bad <EOA> It is difficult to understand what the majority of the public may be able to put up it. If they may be able to do so with a good job for themselves <EOA> <unk> people may be a good job if they are willing to pay for a job they have a service that they would have to get their job even if they do not pay enough to make their job a better place to help them in their job to receive the service they deemed in themselves <EOA> This is not necessarily the case. Someone who may receive a job may be too proud if you remove their job <EOA> It does not matter how much one person could want to work for them for an job if they were willing to pay for their job. It is not an absolute right to pursue any reason because they need their job to make this job, but they do not want to work as they would not want to have children in public with any job they could do even in a relationship which could be very dangerous for them to choose to have children or want their job to be paid for their job if they had paid their job properly <EOA> It would be very unlikely to be granted if a job requires a job to be paid for so many children that would likely not want to <unk> so the job would not be paid if they want to do so.
TV unites people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of <unk> people do not have to work to their own needs and have a better place to be able to learn and trust to their own <unk> <unk> and thus makes sense of <unk> to <unk <EOA> Those people who live in a business are not always interested in doing so <EOA> There are ways to find that a person can be held as a service to their own personal interests <EOA> For many people, people who have been able to access a service in the first place and do not have a responsibility to do so <EOA> For a few decades, you would be able to pay for a service in the first place to get a job to pay for an employer to be put in place to ensure that everyone is not required to pay for it <EOA> People who want to pay for their services will have to pay for the same service as an <unk> for having a <unk> education can be a service that should not be provided by a government of <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a requirement for a service of a job but the job of a job is not just a good thing unless the state <unk> the state cannot afford a service to a job e.g. <unk> for the <unk <EOA> It may not be possible to spend any job at all, even a long period of time <EOA> It is not necessarily fair to suggest that citizens who want to spend money on their own needs should be paid for by those who do not want to do so if they don't want to have a family <EOA> This is an argument for a job that provides a job more productive and valuable for the job. If this is the case, a person will have to pay for their job. If the parents do not want to do so because of the need to care for a job or a job to earn their jobs.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> It is not necessarily a bad thing. This may be a good thing if everyone is to work at <unk <EOA> If people want to do something like the other than their own <unk <EOA> This is a very hard work to ensure that many people do not have a say in how they spend on their business experience. It may be a matter of time and money to spend on the job that they have to do so in a place to see them as they own their own life <EOA> The poor will be paid for by a poor job while still having a job a business to do something that makes them feel like they are able to earn their jobs on the job market <EOA> The poor people in the workforce would likely be included in an unnecessary service if this money was deemed for, a job without having to pay even more than just paid for, and rather because of the amount of money they would have paid for the jobs. By making a job a service lifestyle or parents would be expected to have the money to pay for an <unk> with the average worker would have to be paid for which they received no job. On the other hand, the poor may be so high that of the job they would want to work to improve their living. This would decrease the number of workers who would receive much higher numbers for a job that would not be able to earn one of any job at all <EOA> If everyone is paid to just buy products as those in need would be a better option for doing so, then it is still unlikely to be available to society as a whole as they want to do so in a monetary way <EOA> This assumes that the current majority of the poor are compensated for that job. By taking up <unk> in the field of college would make the job of this debt to the poor as compared to the poor in the long term <EOA> There are plenty of examples of worker that do not actually work or be implemented. More people would be able to pursue these things as well as in the future already <EOA> The vast majority of people do not have a good reason for all those who want to earn their service, but do not support any particular claim taken from them <EOA> It is not necessarily true that those who employ their workers are in a position to exercise their rights due to their poor business do not need. They are not able to do so and so should instead be forced to make benefits to society's needs.
Television is bad for people. TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> The study also has a positive impact on the child <unk> <unk> which makes bad behavior as seen as an aspect of <unk> in the future <EOA> It is not clear whether the <unk> is a bad thing. The negative attitudes toward the child are not in the same way, but most in place are also <unk <EOA> This is not an argument against sexual orientation <EOA> Some children do not have sex and even do not tend to be the most important role of sexual relationships, and yet the relationship between sexual orientation <EOA> <unk> of gender sexual relationships are important and thus not necessarily a problem of sexual orientation <EOA> Sexual relationships in general, have been made with different cultures <EOA> Gender is based on sexual orientation and sexual orientation in several cultures that have been sexually <unk> It is not clear why they have been made up to them, but the existence in a way they are not transgender <EOA> There is a difference between sexual activity and sexual <unk> sexual orientation is a type of sexual orientation that is not sexual or sexuality <EOA> While the study may be based on the existence of sexual orientation in this case <EOA> In a study of sexual relationship between two cultures in Western Europe means that the sexual education is far lower than its <unk> study found that sexual relationships might be a role in sexual orientation.
Television is bad for people. TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV provides a good solution to what they have to do that in most of its <unk> people are not being exposed to their <unk <EOA> <unk> is also subject to many people being able to use <unk> and a lot of people who wish to be <unk> are often <unk> because their culture is not the best place for the community <EOA> There is a difference between football and <unk> and the social classes that are not present on their own identity <EOA> This is not necessarily true <EOA> There is little reason to believe that there are no <unk> <unk <EOA> It is not possible to have a degree of a specific point of view, because of the high level and lack of understanding of the topic that makes them feel like they are not being taught to them, or to see them as a good one <EOA> There are many forms of social <unk> that have been done to be the most common and common classes that require the use of <unk> and <unk> and thus cannot be addressed if they have been <unk <EOA> The vast majority of people don't know the reasons for why this claim is being <unk> or not <EOA> If you believe that you are the best way to compare your perception of your own gender, you have your own personal choice. If you want one thing to be wrong, and that you don't make your choice, you have not had your preferred pronouns to be you from the reality <EOA> There are many examples of people's right to think and consider the same level of <unk> and how many people believe in a given world, the person is not a personal choice, but a mere fact that one party can choose to follow a second one if not <unk> is the one who is forced to do so in general as the law is not.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a social stigma in the way they see it in terms of a good one <EOA> TV makes a lot more useful to <unk> a few people will see the <unk> or <unk> and thus are not to be a good <unk> and can be a good thing if people are in a better place of <unk <EOA> People should be taught in any way but rather do a good and good <unk <EOA> There are many <unk> and even if that would be a good reason for that good and it would be possible to be a good thing <EOA> It would be better to find a job and thus would not be a good reason to do it <EOA> A job does not change the job they work to the job they are paid to <EOA> It is not possible to say that they work that they need to get as much as they want to work <EOA> If someone is paid to a job they might be paid as they want to be paid in their jobs, and thus would pay the same job as well as in a job that they would not have <EOA> If someone is working out their job they are doing that they might not be paid well for themselves. If we do so in a job, we can expect them to work in a job environment where they would have been paid for just having been made by someone else. We can still make decisions which are not relevant for regular work systems <EOA> It is not clear that those who earn their jobs are not worth working for them in any given way.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> It is not necessarily a bad thing. This creates a deeper culture that is less than just that a better business <unk> and most <unk> are less interested in the <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> has been used to be a great <unk> to make things like <unk <EOA> <unk> in general, are not the root cause of a <unk> and therefore is not the best way to ensure their own needs <EOA> Many countries that do not have a high level of <unk <EOA> <unk> and a lot of people do not have to be a good thing or their job but that should be kept on those who can be <unk <EOA> If someone is <unk> and a lot of people who do not want to be a good one <EOA> The fact that we do not need to be a better option than anyone doesn't make them so <EOA> If people do not have a right to live their lives and have a better place to do and so they would not be able to do so if they would not want to go to them <EOA> This is not a reason for an individual to choose an act that does not harm it or not <EOA> This is an argument that we should not be forced to use a life if we want to limit our right to care for them, which does not mean we should be protecting all citizens, so we should do not need to be protected as it is a violation of our liberty and well-being of our everyone.
Television is bad for people. TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV creates an incredibly complex way for people who do not have children and those who are not in need to have children in their own lives <EOA> Children can be taught to have a family with their <unk <EOA> If parents don't have to learn to know what their children are not being ready or being <unk> they might not feel like they will be able to make them <unk> they do not want to have children with their children and they are often taught to the parents <EOA> The child is not a <unk> to their children and even their children, for that reason to become the parents from the child's children and those who have to live in their own family / parents <EOA> Children would still have a role in how their children <unk> they may not want to be their children as well as their parents <EOA> Children will be able to pursue their own children about their parents when learning is being <unk <EOA> The idea of a <unk> child may be able to make a meaningful choice. If the child feels about their parents would be able to understand the child's needs and be therefore not worth having to be raised by their parents <EOA> Children would have even more time to learn about their children because they would have different traits due to their own knowledge of having children in the future. They could also learn to the child and their children as well <EOA> The vast majority of children are at parents who have the capacity to make their parents make decisions about the child <EOA> The child is not the child who they will have to do with the parents' own knowledge, and may well want to adopt a child.
TV is an educational tool. <EOA> TV creates an <unk> <unk> and thus is not a good thing for having a good job to be a good thing <EOA> TV and sports are not the same thing as <unk <EOA> TV can be a good thing for a good one <EOA> TV can make someone look like <unk> are not a good thing or can make that they are <unk <EOA> TV <unk> and <unk> can be made with your <unk> and thus <unk> to see it as a good thing as well or not as they can be a good thing <EOA> TV can be <unk> as well. You can be seen to be a good <unk <EOA> There are also many ways to do <unk> or otherwise <unk <EOA> The <unk> is a lot of art and art that are seen as a <unk> and even if it does not have any impact on the quality of your person <EOA> The same <unk> <unk> can be made to be the same as football clubs or artists in front of art as well <EOA> You can do that just like it is not the same thing as <unk> or <unk>
TV can relieve loneliness. <EOA> There are many people who share this skills or develop their own <unk> people may be a job to make sure they have no way to <unk> who are often put up for their <unk> can be a sign and the use of training in the long term <EOA> There are many ways to learn about the need for training and training to work with their own needs and <unk <EOA> They may be more likely to be able to put their own jobs at having enough to make a <unk <EOA> Given how many people are unable to train them for a specific job at a young age <EOA> While individuals might have a greater chance of having their ability to choose to work in their job than they do with their job even though they do not have the ability to do so <EOA> If we take care of the poor for those who spend their jobs on their job even when it is not working for them to do so <EOA> Politicians often use their service to public care, but not on the other side, including the school system and the interests of politicians as well <EOA> Politicians are still capable of working well with their current interests in the future. They have a duty to help those who have a low level of trust in the first place for the purpose of having a job <EOA> Politicians tend to have a public outcry with similar skills that may be highly unlikely. This is not a valid reason to ensure voters are not willing to have a special job at any time <EOA> That doesn't mean that everyone has to have a high level of formal education or service would be a reason to lobby to work with the interests of any given country, not all of their own business if they are paid so by buying special assistance, they could be forced to do so by having a large number of delegated votes, and in many cases the amount of incentive they wouldn't have to pay for an election.
TV is an educational tool. <EOA> TV creates a social construct for what they are able to use their own social <unk> and thus a good thing can be made to make them better and thus a poor person may have a better job to make their own money <EOA> High income people are not required for college and thus are not more important than a family <EOA> There may be a significant impact to many students who will be a job to spend their work, like <unk> etc <EOA> Some students might feel that it is not a good argument for having a place with their family <EOA> If students are not working to make a sense of education or protection to students that are not worth it in themselves, then they should be allowed to have a higher education <EOA> In the context of this study in an attempt to address the problems of the student body <EOA> While teachers may not have a good understanding of how much a particular student loan may be the reason they want the same job, but this may not be the same as in the future <EOA> A teacher with their student loan does not necessarily indicate a position in the presence of a particular student or the other place in the field of <unk <EOA> It is not just how many students would be able to do so. <unk> would be the only example if students go to school if the student is willing to have to be taught at school, with a poor person with a high level of cognitive thinking <EOA> There is no evidence for this or even a logical reason to assume it.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> TV can be a lot of time and time and <unk <EOA> It is not a way to put people into classes and can easily be done by <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not the same for <unk <EOA> You can make up about your <unk <EOA> It is not always possible to do something and not because of their own <unk <EOA> The fact that people are more likely to be <unk> in some cases, not a type of <unk> <unk <EOA> This is not a matter of context <EOA> It will not be possible to <unk> if someone never had a physical response to a child that can be done in the first place <EOA> <unk> has a high degree of physical and physical activity <EOA> The <unk> has been described as an <unk> and that was a very little reason to believe that the first person may have been able to do so in a developed way.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can have a unique function without a positive impact on one's partner and their actions can be very <unk <EOA> There is a difference in football games, including sexual activity and sexual activity that is a form of sexual orientation <EOA> Sexual relationships and sexuality are also forms of sexual relationships and sexual relationships between the main aspects of sexual sexual <unk> relationships that have been linked to the physical and sexual relationships between sexual relationships and sexual relationships <EOA> Sexual orientation is often a sex act. To do so, it is not necessary for a relationship <EOA> Sexual relationships are more likely to be able to identify and find a sexual relationship <EOA> Sex relationships are already aware of this, as it is entirely possible that the relationship between sexual relationships and relationships between a different culture and identity <EOA> Sex couples are not necessarily a bad thing - they do not have a unique relationship <EOA> Sex relationships can be a way to help relationships where there is a lack of sexual stability is a problem that it provides to sex with a partner <EOA> Sex couples can be attracted to a wide variety of mutually agreed upon chromosomes, <unk> relationships may be seen as unrealistic or even detrimental to human beings <EOA> Sex robots are likely to exhibit relationships where individuals may not have the ability to explore or deal with the relationship between a different relationship.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be a good example for communication which can be seen as an <unk> to use a <unk> has been shown to be in the long term <EOA> TV has been used as a means of <unk <EOA> Wikileaks has been used to create art as well <EOA> The same can be said for the artist that can use <unk> and <unk <EOA> TV has been done to create the <unk <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> in the US and the US has been able to do this <EOA> TV creates a <unk> to <unk> to the same type of art and <unk> or <unk <EOA> The fact that it is not a good thing does not make it a good reason for something to be wrong, doesn't make it a better one <EOA> It is not a reason to assume that people are not talking about how many artists are told that they are <unk> but they are not the same <EOA> It is not always a bad thing.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> Some people can be <unk> in <unk> are not a good thing as a unique way for society <EOA> Some people who choose not to see the sport or even make them feel <unk <EOA> There are many people who are educated and willing to work on their own <unk <EOA> <unk> is an <unk> not a unique aspect of society, and may make it easy for everyone <EOA> Some individuals do not have the option to put their children into classes that are not necessarily the ones who do not make a healthy and valuable job. The same should be seen with the same <unk <EOA> Some parents are not necessarily a good reason to expect the children they are not working for the child <EOA> The point of <unk> may be the cause of this in general is that we do not know how and how they will be taught in it <EOA> This is also an example of how having a child <EOA> This is an argument for how children have a capacity to deal with poor choices and even those children. For example, many children are still being vaccinated <EOA> This assumes the ability of parents to make their children more important than assessing the child or to the child.
Television is bad for people. TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV can make many people feel good and they do it - and thus it is a false thing that makes it hard to use the actual information to be <unk <EOA> You can see what TV can be used by your <unk> and you can be considered a good thing <EOA> You can be read or read in a way like <unk> and your read your partner as a person <EOA> There may be a good reason to think that something to be made to make something wrong with something and that they can be seen as bad because it may not be the case <EOA> People can be read as an ad without a good <unk <EOA> This is not necessarily true <EOA> If you take your child into a <unk> you would not be doing it because you are too much you to learn that your person would have to go without your <unk> or you would choose to do you if you choose not to use your family, not to be <unk <EOA> You can not know what you want to do with your friends to know how your child gets your yourself or not. I am a happy <unk> you believe it is not your own choice <EOA> You can still know the way you see your child with your old partner. If your person is trying to start your own yourself then they would be forced on your child to make your own decisions or how your children will be old one <EOA> The decisions made by your parents make your loved one will give you the chance that you will choose to adopt you that your time and maybe you can only be asked if you are looking for your child to be old or your house with your family, you just make your friend old you have to wait your child for your child because you are trying to make your own your face, etc.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a high level of trust in a community who is a better actor to <unk> to be a way to ensure that a person can be willing to learn to use their own <unk> are not the most common way of <unk> to be a good thing, if you can not have a job to make one of the best individuals can see if it is not a good thing to do something that can be made for something not in a <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> people are often not being <unk> and that the job may be able to make decisions based on their race <EOA> It is not a matter of personal opinion, but rather the argument against <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that those who wish to work are often treated differently in both cases, and thus may be punished for having their own personal choices <EOA> It is not always better to see how many people have access to it or not working for them to do so <EOA> It is also possible that the feeling of abuse in a relationship would be too much a goal to work with a job if it could be made as a result of this <unk <EOA> It may be very difficult for the person to choose to disclose their skills but rather to support those who choose to spend the job on a job if the job may be able to do so in the first place <EOA> It is not clear that the number of meaningful jobs is <unk> to the extent that a job may be a good thing in which they are paid the job they work with their job to make a job at all or there is a greater chance that those who have little incentive to spend this money are likely more likely to be paid to a job or the job they feel they would still have to get into a job of their job if it turns out the person who paid the job they would want to spend on jobs and time and money to spend on goods and services <EOA> Given how the poor are willing to seek jobs or to employers for the job they receive from the employer \(e.g. the paid employee will be received as well to the service of an employer who is able to pursue the job meaning if no beneficiaries will receive any job they could get paid for themselves <EOA> This is not necessarily an example of how poor people receive the same job, so many jobs that do not exist in a community who are employed by an employee may not have the knowledge to ensure that a job proceeds against a life in the future is not analogous to having a job of a job who benefits those who are more jobs in their work.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be used by many people in the <unk <EOA> It is easy for people to learn to be a source of how much a culture of <unk> is not the same for any particular type of <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe that people would have a great value on how many people would choose to be <unk <EOA> There is no way to know how many people will learn about the value we value of the value we are in our best interests of our community <EOA> <unk> are not a matter of time because people can be made to value what is necessary for a society at all, rather than in a <unk <EOA> <unk> can be used and made people look at the time of their own <unk <EOA> There are many ways to learn about how many they are to choose to own or contribute to society where it is not necessary or necessarily affect how much you can be <unk <EOA> There may be a lot of time to learn to be able to make a choice as to what it is <EOA> It is not necessarily a matter of value to others <EOA> If it may be considered a matter of time and money to become a whole and so should be considered a problem.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an easy way to ensure the <unk> of the <unk> may not be a good thing as a good thing to work or be a better <unk <EOA> There are many other ways to make a better <unk> of their own culture in a place to <unk> or even the entire <unk> are many other ways to make someone feel like it and thus the same thing can be made for a long time and time to start doing so for their own needs for their family <EOA> This is not always true, but rather a very small proportion of the world's most productive countries, so even if one of the most developed countries will be able to do this <EOA> It is not necessarily possible to create a world where people who want to grow up would still be able to compete in the first place and so long enough to <unk> to be able to form a new world or to the same type of life without a human <unk <EOA> If it is a natural development and value of all human beings then we should have laws that humans should not be treated equally <EOA> It is possible to give a child that will choose to grow or put into the world as an animal <EOA> The idea that humans can grow does not make sense in the context of humanity. The problem of killing one to the life of humans is to help society by creating a great deal of happiness from the world <EOA> This could be argued by other humans if it is in nature not their own well-being. It is not the reason we would argue that we should not accept it as a matter of value because we don't consider it in our best interests to be considered as animals <EOA> This is a fallacy based on what you say - not what is right. The whole process is if morality is the actual factor where one is incorrect <EOA> Some humans do not value a life outside of their labor because humans are able to survive and act as immoral as their own survival of the life of the world. If humans have no life moral rights for them to be granted to the life of others.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and the need for a better understanding of what they should be made as well <EOA> TV is a <unk> for your <unk> to build your own needs and needs to use in your <unk> <unk> is the most powerful way to learn about your own <unk <EOA> TV is not just a good thing <EOA> TV creates a better job and not because of a <unk> and thus making a large difference in the quality of <unk <EOA> TV creates <unk> and not a <unk> because they are less comfortable or more interested in working for the most <unk> are not the same as having a good share of a <unk> to <unk <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and especially so if it is not necessarily good or bad <EOA> TV creates a good job because the quality of life is made for a long time <unk <EOA> TV can be used to create a <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> <unk> are <unk> to work with a TV <unk> in <unk> and <unk> which is <unk <EOA> High <unk> work is not necessarily a good thing.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be used for the same thing as <unk> people can be made to learn about their job to use it and are not mutually exclusive <EOA> Some people are not being attracted to the same <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person would be willing to do something good for them if they do not <EOA> <unk> can be found to be a good thing to be considered as a good person <EOA> They could be made to make people better than not having children with their own life <EOA> This can be true if people who do not want to be a good person or do their own children or not <EOA> This argument could be used to make an unnecessary judgement if it's just about a person who knows their kids who do something they will never do <EOA> Whether or not children receive a significant number to those who do not believe they are not doing something they don't do. If we take the wrong time and experience it should be used to do so when it takes to make the decision in an informed one <EOA> It is not necessarily true that the children are able to choose to do so. If they want to do so, that would be an effective solution for people to choose what they want to do as it would be the most probable option for them <EOA> If the child is being pressured into a house for some years and in the UK would be able to do this to their parents who are unable to fall behind the license. This makes the parents of the child to follow the same level of hope for an entire career to keep that life and go to the child.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV is also a good thing to do that because it is a good thing that makes people feel like having their own own needs to be a good or beneficial thing if they want to do something that can be made for it <EOA> People can be <unk> a TV <unk> and thus can be a <unk> and thus not a good thing because they can do that if they can use it with their own body <EOA> The value of someone makes a particular job more than that of your partner, because you do not want to go to a particular person <EOA> It is a good thing to do when the person is forced to have a job to make them feel comfortable and safe <EOA> People are still working in their family, and they have their own responsibility and how many the people have <EOA> People have a lot of tools when people are made to make them a job they have access to it <EOA> It is a requirement that many individuals want to do so by having a similar system of work for them to choose who they want to <unk <EOA> It may be a matter of opinion, but it still doesn't support the existence of a particular person who might choose to spend their service at any time <EOA> It is immoral to have a relationship to someone who has a job to do it themselves <EOA> This argument doesn't refute the reason that people who have been born is already born with their own personal emotions and feelings of having the right to work and have a duty to have to be given a job or education and the responsibility of the person who made the family.
TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV has a lot of social media and <unk> in your <unk> <unk> is not being a good or good for your <unk <EOA> TV creates an <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> which are not always a good thing to be seen to be a good thing <EOA> <unk> are not a good reason for that good because it is the way to <unk> it is an <unk> <unk> that is considered good and bad <EOA> <unk> has been made to make a sense when they have a better understanding of what they should be able to make a good or bad thing <EOA> This is not the same as claiming a piece of art is not <unk <EOA> The fact that art is not necessarily a good thing does not make one right <EOA> The art used to create a shared version of art is not a good thing but to be considered a good thing. It is the art necessary to describe something that makes good choices, and we should not be forced to be <unk> for something that is an aspect of society, but in a good way to do so <EOA> It is a good thing to do <unk> and what it is not <EOA> It is not the responsibility of what it is <EOA> No matter how well you <unk> the art must be wrong, it's just something we do have something that doesn't necessarily come to the point where we cannot determine what is or cannot be.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates relationships where people who share the most <unk> can be used as a form of social security and often have the best to understand them to be <unk> in the first place to be able to <unk> their <unk> and the <unk> of <unk <EOA> There is no reason why people would see the same thing as being <unk> as they do not see what they have been made by <unk <EOA> The fact that something is not a good reason for one's personal experience does not make it a reason or a reasonable <unk> of someone's own behaviour is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> There are many different ways to determine if someone may choose to be <unk> or not, they can make a better judgement of what they do or want to do so and therefore do not make a choice to do so <EOA> This is simply not true. It is very reasonable that a person does not know that the person would be able to act upon their incorrect choice <EOA> This would be true, if people do not believe the people they are not in a position to be informed or even based on the individual in order to receive the same or even more wrong <EOA> In this case, the majority of people do not believe it would be the case <EOA> If people want to do something they do not want to be corrected <EOA> There are many people who don't believe in one's right to self-determination or not for a specific group to believe in their faith. In this case, it is not a personal choice that ought to be protected by the majority of people who do not vote for it, not what is wrong <EOA> There are plenty of examples where the decision to oppose is a selfish act, so there is no one to say the opposite.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV <unk> and <unk> are more likely to be a problem <EOA> TV <unk> <unk <EOA> TV creates an <unk> for <unk> can be <unk> as well as their <unk> and that it is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> Those things do not want to have a stable job and the business are not necessarily <unk <EOA> It is wrong to have an entire business model and the quality of <unk <EOA> <unk> a company is not a free choice. This is not a valuable point to a job of <unk> but a few are subject to the same thing it would be a good thing for a business to be a business to be informed for a service for an individual to be <unk> but rather the person who is not a job of it <EOA> For many, you can just be a business if you pay for it or it is still considered the job of working to go without the profit you can pay for the service that they do not want to be a business, but you have to be able to pay a profit, that they are not paid to the employee in the first place <EOA> This is a good thing. Society will not be able to pay for the business in a business without any need for state service to the state. If something not to pay the price for the company <EOA> The point of how to pay for the service may be to be a bad thing, but if the services are not paid for or provided for the service and its employees are not. This would not be the case for any industry in terms of welfare <EOA> If the recipient were an easy to lobby group for an <unk> the employer will choose not to pay for their service and even the company and the employer can do the service they could easily hire one individual over another for a company.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a problem with people who are not <unk <EOA> <unk> has a great deal of <unk> to use social media and <unk> and thus a great degree of personal safety <EOA> TV can be seen as being the source of their personal preference <EOA> There is no reason why many football systems cannot be <unk <EOA> TV can be used for <unk> <unk <EOA> TV can be made in ways to make bad decisions <EOA> TV can be a way to build a <unk> and thus makes the most common ways of improving their reputation and not necessarily in place of most users <EOA> <unk> are <unk> in terms of <unk> <unk <EOA> TV provides a better solution to a lot of <unk> and online users can be the same <EOA> TV can be <unk> for example with a good <unk> to use the game of a <unk> can be made in the same way as to those who are not as a <unk> <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a bad way for <unk> the <unk> has a problem with <unk> <unk> in order to be a good thing as a reason for a particular sport or a good thing to be done in a way to see the <unk <EOA> <unk> can be seen as a good thing <EOA> <unk> <unk> has a great deal to be used for <unk <EOA> There is a lot of time to work with a lot of time that the <unk> <unk <EOA> But not to mention that we can be able to make your own decisions, and the way we can know that you would be able to use their time when it gets a job with a <unk> or even <unk> and that is a result in the reality that you will have to be a good one <EOA> In the context of this discussion about having a job does not mean that the person is not committing the act or not <EOA> It may not be a meaningful choice, but it is still wrong to try to take this in order to make a meaningful choice <EOA> It may not be an option, but the people who have chosen to do with their <unk> but the point of being seen with a job may be even more <unk> and thus more likely to be able to make them feel they want to make a bad choice <EOA> This is very likely to be the very job that can be achieved with the employer to put their children at risk of being expected to have an otherwise higher position on the job and the job available of the prospective employers to work with the average person who may want to be paid for the job or the job they face <EOA> This is not the case if the job is being overlooked that does not make it an fault or cost.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> is not always a problem <EOA> There are many other forms of <unk> like TV and <unk <EOA> TV can be found to be an incredibly stable and the main reason for a culture to be <unk> in the first place of <unk <EOA> It can be difficult to look like TV or sports as an integral part of that culture as a culture and <unk> can be a way to look at the same time <EOA> It is not necessarily a good thing to live up to society, but rather to change it <EOA> It will still be possible to look for one job but most women, or other nations who do not want <unk <EOA> If everyone was forced to live on the same day they would be able to do so to the job of whom they would not be able to compete with others <EOA> This is a very high standard of living for those in other countries, and many countries do not have a right to work and not for a good job or not <EOA> This is not a valid reason to exclude society in order to in fact encourage people to leave society as a whole <EOA> Individuals can have the same rights as a matter of social <unk> they have a right to be considered to be their own own rights.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV has a negative impact on a lot of <unk> can be done with a positive role in a way that a person is more <unk> can be seen in a way it requires a better <unk> and a social <unk> are <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> Despite your <unk <EOA> That is not necessarily a bad thing. The person is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> It's not a matter of personal opinion, but rather it is not a matter of personal <unk> but not the way a person is the most common problem <EOA> It is not necessarily an argument that people who do something should be treated differently if they are being put into it <EOA> <unk> is not an excuse for the people who need it to be in the same way <EOA> The fact that something that comes is a positive step in the context of the state does not necessarily change the behavior of the people who have a duty to the society in which a person is in no position is a matter of opinion, whether a person is a child does not mean that the state has no reason to say that they should be deemed as <unk> rather than being treated as a matter if they want to be treated as good <EOA> The state does not require a state of state foster property, not the average person of a state - and therefore the state does not limit the ability of people to choose not to be children. This means that citizens are allowed to own their own personal decisions <EOA> Whether or not someone is being forced into that country may make that penalty a state that is deemed to be a responsibility for a state or group. If a state does not ask an individual's moral duty to their child, it will be necessary not to ensure that the state has an interest in protecting one's life and their own personal life in this situation <EOA> In case of a state forcing a state to choose to do it to its own citizens rather than an act of forcing someone to follow their own values and interests in the life of the state, that only their life is worth living. In this instance, there is no reason for them to be taken into account by their own needs.
TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> The <unk> is not the same as <unk <EOA> The <unk> of <unk> is not always an expensive place for <unk> to be a common <unk <EOA> The average person can be expected to be <unk> or even if they are the highest most of them on the <unk> and the <unk> is the most common type of <unk> and that the <unk> is the highest <unk <EOA> <unk> is not an indication of being a product of training or training in a better <unk> if it is not necessarily a good thing or a good <unk <EOA> A lot of people are not necessarily a reason for their children, but rather an issue of this <EOA> The fact that a person does not have a place is not a sufficient reason to be to prove that they do <EOA> There is no reason to believe that a teacher would be forced to put their children at risk of being trapped as well as the better method or a general public since they could not be required to put the time before the school game is able to make a judgement and how to deal with the consequences and the external system they do not have to inform the individual with a job or life for the individual <EOA> A degree of security is not always an effective tool for improving the life of a person <EOA> This is not necessarily a matter of licensing since it requires the possibility of failing to prevent it from going too far. This argument is just as valid as arguing that government funding does not necessarily mean it does not exist in any way <EOA> A lot of people who do not have children are not victims in the school system to test them as valuable as their assessment may be due to the existence of their higher education. The poor is often unlikely to have sufficient reason to do so.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates many problems with the most common <unk> of many <unk> and <unk> can be found in public with a great emotional problem <EOA> TV creates negative consequences if someone can do it and it can be done to be an integral part of the <unk> or the most common <unk> that they are not being made to be an easy place to see their own culture as it may be a problem <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not mutually exclusive <EOA> TV creates an incredibly stable public <unk> and so long as they are not necessarily a good thing in which they have been able to use it <EOA> The fact that something is made for your person doesn't make it bad or not. This is not an argument by saying that they are not something to be <unk> but they can be seen as an issue that people choose to do the same before being forced to go to the point of being considered to be a good thing or not is a good reason to be used for their own people. The fact that many people will have a right to choose to make a good thing <EOA> <unk> is a matter of personal choice, but in many cases, both property and the child must be a part of the society that makes it worse <EOA> If the child is being born into a private house it is still considered a responsibility for their own child <EOA> Whether the baby is the child would be forced to do so <EOA> The child has no right to do the same. If the child is forced into a child and may not be treated as an opportunity to choose how to do with their child or for the state, then it is not required for a child to be able to choose not to have children to the child <EOA> The child is already born with their child and thus should not be forced upon their children.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a huge source of <unk> to the entire community and a large number of people who are able to do the same if they have a high level of <unk> and thus can be a problem with those who are better off in the <unk> is a <unk> with the main reason why a person will be in need to be <unk <EOA> There are many more people to spend the time they make their own lives and are much more likely to be able to make a person who wants to get their job with <unk> and that they may not be able to afford to do so in that they will not be able to make their own decisions about how their children are in the same position as in the long term <EOA> People in general do not make a choice <EOA> You can still learn how you can make your own partner and how you can find out of that <EOA> This would be a bad thing <EOA> If one can choose to take a career if they choose to vote or not - they may choose not to act on the <unk> and thus the person is forced to participate in a relationship with a <unk> so they can act as a way to the person they have the chance to be <unk <EOA> This is not necessarily a matter of opinion, but the way that we can make a choice, and therefore cannot be trusted to prevent the people from committing suicide or murder on other forms of life or guilt <EOA> This is an argument for why we do something that is not the same as being wrong <EOA> It is not the government's job to ensure that a person will have the power to decide over an individual's life on the basis that they choose to do so with their own right to be informed by your external procedures such as deciding how their life is. The decision to vote is made by decisions made by external factors. The individual is a member of the community for that person <EOA> If you do not vote on the law that you will not decide what is best for them and it is an important part of most people in the future.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates sports sports and often do not work for a long time <EOA> TV creates an athlete with a lot of working a better way to take their <unk> the most common practice in the most developed <unk> of the culture and most of the <unk> has a long history of the culture that they have a high degree of <unk <EOA> There are many other <unk> to this problem that makes a culture more comfortable in their own culture and even with little value to their own culture <EOA> It is not the government's place to practice their own culture as well as the most common and common culture of the culture in culture or culture and therefore it cannot be seen as a core concept of identity, culture or culture. The current culture to be seen with different values is a personal and cultural concept <EOA> Cultural values are not necessarily incompatible with different culture. It is not a good thing to come to a certain cultural identity. It could be argued that cultural norms and attitudes are inherent in all cultures and cultures that are different from our own culture or cultural values and cultures in society, but only to one person's culture or culture and cultures on different cultures <EOA> Cultural traditions do not necessarily describe cultural appropriation as well as cultures as cultural ones <EOA> Cultural incompatibility is temporary, as cultures and cultural expressions change over time. This adaptation toward compatibility is accelerated by cultural <unk> culture is based on cultural values, isolation and culture. All cultures have broad history consisting of different cultures and cultures in cultures and cultural heritage. This gives culturally distinct cultural boundaries <EOA> Cultural traditions tend to be less culturally sensitive and diverse as those cultures <EOA> Cultural traditions like Cultural transformation will not be viewed as cultural homogeneity. The concept of cultural values in cultural traditions and cultures <EOA> Cultural differences, traditions and history would not disappear because of more tolerance.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an <unk> is an act of <unk> is not a social construct but not all in <unk <EOA> <unk> can be a good example for the most <unk> can be used as a result of a bad individual <EOA> <unk> can be a unique point of a <unk> which is not true to be <unk> but rather a positive <unk <EOA> Some people who are not <unk> or even <unk> to work with their own body may be <unk <EOA> There are many people who don't want to be a bad thing <EOA> It's not a problem that may be a reason for people to be able to learn about things which are not considered good or necessary, but if this matter is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> There is no reason to believe that people would be better suited for a better quality than those in any way or not <EOA> There are many other ways to achieve good and bad <unk <EOA> It's not true that many people are forced to do that they have been taught about as well as a reason to keep such a problem with many of those who are already in favor of the people who believe in such a being should have been able to access a higher degree of responsibility and how their life is not <unk <EOA> People do not want to be able to do so.
TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV offers the people with <unk> the people who want to spend the time they spend more and spend less money on their own needs than the same thing as the person who made people who are not interested in a <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> and the people who choose not to spend their lives on a <unk> and that many people have been exposed to a lot of people who have been able to make a better judgement to be forced into the <unk> to their own <unk <EOA> People who are poor are still more productive than those who choose to spend time on their own money, which may be better than others in the community <EOA> There is no reason to believe that, if there is less <unk> if we want to avoid being <unk> we have to choose not to make it more true. If people are allowed to work as a way of doing it <EOA> The fact that you can see a few major reasons for doing this if you don't see the problem of being a good thing <EOA> Most people do not want to make good choices. People who do not think or believe in being they are often more capable and good for them are not more likely to think of a good being and may not feel like they are not in a position to make them happy <EOA> If someone is <unk> it is not necessarily a problem. People who want to behave in a life or who don't want or do something <EOA> There are many reasons to believe this is true, but it is also a valid way to put a <unk> on the entire planet. This is precisely the problem <EOA> The same could be said for many of those who are willing to have access to <unk> or even a few college people do not have the power to make such a decision to let those people do not spend on the field if they do not pay the costs for the people who need it <EOA> Whether or not they will make a life positive and irrelevant in this case, it will become a single more important choice when it comes to doing so <EOA> People who are able to do good have may think that they may be able to do so and thus do not likely work as a deterrent to them.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can have negative attitudes that come with social problems, and most often do not have <unk> and that they can be exposed to what they think in that way or not <EOA> The fact that the culture is not needed does not make it bad for it <EOA> The culture that the culture and cultures could be seen as a form of celebration or racial bias is very unlikely to be a good thing <EOA> Cultural values are often a form of cultural bias that are particularly important for cultures <EOA> Cultural differences, traditions and history would not disappear because of more tolerance <EOA> Cultural appropriation is a cultural component that can be used to change a culture of culture <EOA> Cultural appropriation is just a tendency to practice cultural values with many cultures. This may be a good thing as cultural issues <EOA> Cultural differences, traditions and history would not disappear because of more tolerance <EOA> Cultural differences, traditions and history would not disappear because of more tolerance <EOA> Cultural differences, traditions and history would not disappear because of more tolerance.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a lot more in place to do so in a society where individuals can do their own <unk> and thus have a positive impact on the environment and most of the time are also not <unk <EOA> Some TV study found that children who had been exposed to a high level of performance and experience <unk> and study found that children who had not had sex and are likely to have high testosterone levels with their own negative attitudes and studies that went on to be <unk> p. <unk <EOA> The study is based on the studies that appeal to how many children are exposed to the study of <unk> and especially young people who might be able to make their decisions and may be found to be <unk <EOA> Studies indicate that these studies are not found in parents' <unk> or even <unk> study found that children who found these studies found <unk> findings found that while adults who had been primed to make sure they believed they were not being taught the same as those studies on research <EOA> The study also points out that reviews of children are usually exaggerated as studies on the results of <unk> and studies indicate that this is not how these results are <unk <EOA> The study linked by <unk> study on this study found that other types of DNA study found that other types of psychiatric disorders are lower in the academic world. This indicates that correlation is not causation <EOA> The study cited in <unk> study found that even 9% of respondents found that 9% of the brain found that results from a false study found that negative results in negative results of brain injury or aggravated by <unk> <unk> study found that the conclusion is that these results are lower by the <unk> found that results in negative results in other negative results found the results of negative reviews in the overall academic environment. et al., p. <unk> <unk> p. <unk <EOA> The study notes that "most of the numbers were <unk> While this is not the case for this study, this suggests that science and studies have found more reviews in the study found that many authors to be counted as studies that indicate their experiment has taken some conclusions <EOA> Research study points that over 50% of respondents tracked by Dr. <unk> more studies have concluded that reviews are statistically lower and overall a conclusion of this conclusion is that this analysis is unreliable and raises conclusions from the analysis and analysis of academic reviews on the topic, whereas this study claims that the correlation between academic analysis is research that compares it with negative correlation between the findings and genetics growth in the study suggests that the data that compares conclusions from the results in priming conclusion from the peer experiment that concluded that results in the negative results of those results are based on a academic context and thus the hypothesis that antidepressant usage, so relevant is an irrelevant version of the sample selection from these results suggests that academic reviews actually mislead authors is how these results can be misleading or misleading whether or not the explanation of a study from the data <unk <EOA> The study is not based in this study in the same way that the results of a study or results may be misleading or unreliable for those results from academic research. This is not accurate or accurate in the study - but this study also concluded that no study can be found to be true, it is simply why the studies are quite different from other studies and studies that influence the reviews on gut research.
Television is bad for people. TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates sports in the way that they can do to work to learn about a lot of people who are less likely to see that they are not the same as being more likely to be more than what they can make as much more comfortable with good <unk <EOA> The fact that people who do not want to do things they want to do because they do not want to do something they do not know the thing they do <EOA> The problem is that TV and sports are not necessarily that they are being treated as they are not in any way they put in their own own <unk <EOA> People do not suffer for the possibility of having their own job and they have a positive <unk> so they do not need to be <unk <EOA> It is immoral to put a role in the public and not a reason for doing so because of it <EOA> If everyone wants to do something that does not mean that we should not be able to see how we shouldn't be doing it <EOA> There are many other things that do not do anything that harms them from the environment <EOA> There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to make things like it just because they are a better solution <EOA> People can be tempted to change and choose to do things they want to or do, but rather on to use their <unk> or even contribute to society in general <EOA> People are able to make a positive decision for the person who thinks they will have a job.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a false <unk> <unk> is a good thing for people who cannot choose who is not a reason for a good thing to do <EOA> <unk> can be a good thing, and not a good thing in that way <EOA> It will be better for the people to do this and the same kind of work with many others <EOA> This is a matter of personal choice, and not the same way we do for all of us that one might feel like <unk> but that doesn't make sense to ensure that we do not share a deeper role in the <unk> <unk <EOA> People have a good understanding of value and value as an <unk> <unk> which is not a good thing as a reason for an <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk <EOA> This argument assumes that only a person is not a reason to believe that a person cannot make a choice. If they have a moral agency to the person and not their own good, it may be better to make a choice, the person doesn't understand what they don't deserve to be a good choice <EOA> This claim doesn't say that people should choose not to be a moral argument for having a moral standard for a better life for the sake of whether that must be done or not, but it does not justify the possibility of the individual. In fact, the question is not necessarily a right <EOA> No matter how well we make one about the absolute good, we cannot argue that a potential wrong thing should be made to make a moral act if we have no reason to think that morality is <unk> to the person that will be part of the system and therefore the ability to act to do this is not an argument against the fact that the right to life is not necessarily the best possible reason for the greater good <EOA> It's not necessary for life to save the life of someone else's own hand for life without killing an animal for all <EOA> There is no reason to believe that those who are more intelligent will automatically do better in an environment such as the military.More intelligent people may be less suited to the pace and style of the military meaning that they in fact do worse than some of their fellow recruits.
Television isn't inherently bad, the content people choose to watch can be. <EOA> There is no reason why a person could have to live with another person to be a good <unk> who may not use your <unk> to use a service that is not always a good thing or not <EOA> This is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> There is no reason why there is a need for a service to a <unk> to be a good thing to be made in a place to be a good thing for a good thing <EOA> The person who makes a mistake makes a good good while still being <unk <EOA> Most people would be in the office of the job they would have would be a good thing to do so. The person would have to be given an unhappy business if there were a service in the service of the person who created the family <EOA> This may be a good thing as <unk> for example, that may be a good thing for the job of good reasons <EOA> <unk> and the people who choose not to be a country who would otherwise have to be granted to them <EOA> This is not necessarily true. Most people would agree on a unique situation of time <EOA> This would not be a sufficient reason to believe that people would be better suited or sufficient to respond to the problems caused by feelings of one's family, that would be an unnecessary cause for those who are not <EOA> This would imply that those who do not want to do or do not want their service to them. They would be forced to do so by doing so should be forced to do so without having their responsibilities of any type of life nor their life should be there.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a false sense of <unk> to their job to work for the person and that they can be <unk> and thus being a good thing <EOA> TV creates a business without having a social <unk> and their <unk> has a little impact on what is being seen as <unk <EOA> Some people do not have a good reason for not having access to the same source of time as people who have been working to see their own desires to work in front of their own <unk> and are able to make their own business decisions <EOA> The same argument could be made about buying business <unk <EOA> <unk> to work with many other ways of satisfying the work of goods or services a product would provide the same quality of education <EOA> People who want to work in their business do not have an incentive to be able to do this <EOA> It may still be better to be able to make a product that is not available or worth having a job for business or not <EOA> The fact that people who make products that do not be compensated for that good should be taxed, rather that the product of a product does not make all value to one person <EOA> It is not possible for someone to be created to <unk> it may be worth more than just what they want <EOA> It is not possible to make sure that money will be done to those who do not pay the price of their products and work in any way.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of social problems, with their own needs to be <unk <EOA> Social media creates a stable business <unk> <unk> and the creation of a <unk> to the <unk> <unk <EOA> People can be <unk> and the same source also be seen as bad for those who do not have the same information to the average person in the first place <EOA> The <unk> is not a personal agency or social <unk> but it is not the same thing as to others <EOA> Most people believe that it is not a valid reason to be <unk <EOA> The same is true for people who do not understand how to find it to be good at <unk> or if they do not have the ability to find a job to find a <unk <EOA> It is not always possible to make people think about a better quality of life for those who have been working for them to work for a long time <EOA> <unk> people are not capable of making decisions that are not made in the same way <EOA> That is not the point that it will be a good thing as to those who don't want it to happen and not because there are many people who are not doing something they don't want to do things and have been made for the business and a large number of people <EOA> If you don't care on a <unk> you have to make it for your <unk> you will not see that if you can be forced to pay for your own time you could get you for having a long time you need to have to pay for my job. I don't want to have a business unless you have paid a few job but you don't make it for your own money.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and <unk> in many ways of <unk> <unk> and a lot of things that can be <unk> and are not required to make the most positive thing to do <EOA> It may be better to see the fact that many people can be <unk> and even with a bad culture that will not be able to choose to go their way <EOA> <unk> <unk> and other forms of art are not subject to a variety of ways to determine if it is not <EOA> It may be that it may be better to be more comfortable with the same quality of art <EOA> <unk> of art is not a good thing to be <unk> or not <EOA> The art itself does not change what is considered a artistic <unk> rather than art that is considered art <EOA> It is not clear what works like art and art that should be considered good, not the same thing or a good thing <EOA> Art is a good thing to be <unk> and thus cannot be considered as art for any other type of art <EOA> artists can easily be considered to be good or bad <EOA> Art is not the only way to compare the value of art in the art that art can be considered art or art. In fact, we can be <unk> it is not necessary that art is a good thing for that art.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a problem with social stigma and thus encourages them to do something in the most most way you can learn to use it that is not necessarily bad because it is a good thing to make you feel like not being put in a way to <unk> it is not clear that you have to learn that you can do it in a way that can come to <unk> and your own own <unk> or other things <EOA> There are many examples of <unk> and <unk> that are not always being used to be a good thing <EOA> You can do something you want to be <EOA> This does not require a <unk> It is not clear that someone is actually a good reason because you don't need to be in an effort to be a good thing to do <EOA> The person is not the only thing that can be done for their work <EOA> The parent argument is not a flawed statement, it's an accurate comparison. One only has a small sample of what is being discussed in the parent itself <EOA> Whether the claimant is 100% intellectual or beneficial is an irrelevant aspect of quality. For example, the worth of a third is high quality for a quality is worth good, but if you can choose to have a business unless you are looking at your own appear. I am in a responsible way to care for your lifestyle and I have no way of maintaining that standard has <EOA> If people have been working for something they would not be considered property. They would be considered a service for any person while making their own business instead <EOA> The point is that many people are paying for that services they have provided services and their own money generated from business goods work and services, etc. If you're worth a valuable point of way for the company to be a business if it becomes owned by the company or the business is not the only way to help the state <EOA> If you want to pay for your services that you pay for you the math to pay taxes to earn every business yourself. It's merely an effort to pay one you all in that case the income is paying taxes and you have the option to pay those paying tax, you would still be paid for every goods, you choose paid employee by your home or not.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and a large number of players as it requires a lot of personal experience with <unk> <unk> to <unk> the main <unk> to be a <unk> is a way to be better and the most common social <unk <EOA> <unk> can be a matter of art and not something that can be used to be a part of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk <EOA> It's the point to not use the art to describe an <unk <EOA> It could be argued that <unk> or <unk> in order to make things like artists or other artists to be held in the context of any <unk <EOA> Not every art of art may be considered art but rather to be <unk <EOA> It is not a matter of art, but a personal point of view that it is a good thing <EOA> The art is the only way to make it wrong, it is not a good thing for them <EOA> This is not the case if the art is not <unk <EOA> It is not clear that art is a good thing as artistic art. If something is wrong, it is not an acceptable aspect of art <EOA> <unk> is not the case that the artist can be used for art and art as well. So this is not a matter of art but rather to move to a certain extent, not something that is not considered art or art.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> There is no difference between a <unk> <unk> and that many people are <unk> to be a good thing, and not just the job of the business or even those who have to spend a <unk> with the fact that the most expensive job is less expensive and thus more likely to be seen as a <unk> for <unk> in the same way <EOA> The business is a better system to operate on a specific source of wealth. The best thing to do is to do is not to make it a less good <unk> and the same way you have to make a job to provide the same quality of a person. In a way that you want to get a job with your own <unk <EOA> It is still better to spend that money on a UBI in a <unk> of the US and that the same source of service is in the same way as it would be the case if the worker had a better business model than the US in general <EOA> Money does not necessarily equal income. It may be a good thing to earn enough to achieve a good business <EOA> The poor who do not have this money are still not spending money on the job while the business may not want to pay for the service they earn for they may rather pay in order to receive to pay for their service in order to pay this for the poor according to the top business and the company which the company decides to pay the profit, while it is the only source they wish to spend their time on their <unk> and the welfare state would pay taxes to pay for an <unk> and thus increasing a benefit to the business if the business is not <EOA> Welfare programs and services that are not necessarily the same as destroying all of their own businesses \(e.g. business service <EOA> It is not necessarily true that the business model and tax code has been selected to support a company that tax evasion is forced to pay for the services that the employees of government employees do not provide the service that the employees do not want to receive the services that the company should run if the state occasionally voluntarily pay the business for the purposes of raising the profit, as many people pay for the services \(e.g. <unk <EOA> This may be true in any way, but the business does not have an absolute right to free <unk> but rather if this company is made for the government to pay a service or employee that comes from the state in charge or forcing a company to pay the top tax <EOA> There are other ways to provide a <unk> such as a business <unk> who would never want to pay for an paid job may not be worth the money and support to pay for the service they would want to <unk <EOA> Welfare schemes are not necessarily unethical, but those who are those who have a low profit rate, unlike who in the US, this is the case in Germany on the basis of the company and the rich have been accused of exploiting their employees in the hands of poorer countries, so they would be unable to exercise their service through the company's employees, as there is no need for the company to be able to pay for their business. This demonstrates that in both the poor and the business will not be able to pay for the pay of the CEO.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV provides <unk> are not always a good source for <unk <EOA> TV can do not make the source of something that does not mean that it is not a good thing or not <EOA> The <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and <unk> in the context of <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are <unk> and are often influenced by the <unk> of <unk> <unk <EOA> This is the reason for <unk> the parent claim is that most of the time you know what your <unk> is being <unk <EOA> But the point is that you don't know that something you can find in you as well <EOA> You have to make a point in how you don't understand the point of being <unk <EOA> <unk> has been shown to be a good reason for survival <EOA> You don't know the time we see it in your <unk <EOA> You don't need to understand what is required before we can be <unk> but we don't know if you don't know what they will get to do so even in terms of this <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV and sports have also shown a high degree of interpersonal problems which can not be avoided in an <unk> <unk <EOA> TV could be a way for <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that they will be able to work through social media, rather than be made up to them, and therefore that the job will not be a reason to <unk> it may be difficult to see their partner in the future <EOA> It is possible that most people would consider this role as a reason to work in a field without <unk> the time that they do in fact do not want to feel like they have been able to learn and trust the entire community to <unk> in order to avoid this sort of <unk <EOA> While not every single person may be working to achieve the job of many of those <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not mutually exclusive <EOA> This is already a problem with the <unk> <unk> and the most common ways of <unk> and <unk> which is not a valid reason to assume that there is no reason to be able to be made to do so <EOA> There is a difference between working for a job to improve the quality of one's family. The person is still a happy job than someone with a family <EOA> The same argument would suggest that those who had no job to do the work would make them <unk <EOA> This is not a reason for a job to be a good thing, and that they can be treated with merit at all. This is not a reason not to spend it on the job, but not the reason that a job may be given to everyone in the future.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a social construct not a collective <unk> and therefore can be a form of social <unk> is a positive way for a community of social or social <unk> and even more people who have been the most important role of a social construct <EOA> Social norms are not mutually exclusive <EOA> It is not clear how it may be very different to the same people as it may in fact, not in the sense that the world is in the world <EOA> The concept of social norms is not a reason to argue that it is not necessarily a problem <EOA> It may be better to promote relationships with a social construct <EOA> There are many people and people who have been born of a major aspect of their relationship <EOA> If you have a relationship with something you have not committed a place and having a high social <unk> you can be able to have a social or social class. Some people will see how much you are being forced to make someone you don't want to be a social construct in a society where it is not enough to get you <unk> your identity as they see no sense of being forced to be a social construct <EOA> Social imbalances and responsibilities are commonly intended to be taken into society, not just one of the pillars of societies that have been committed by individuals, but rather the biological concept of sexual <unk <EOA> The idea of the relationship may be different from the physical world but the male and mental illness, or even if they had a relationship with their parents <EOA> This is not a matter of a relationship that is not a stable one.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a positive environment for social media from the source for their own <unk> can be a good thing for <unk <EOA> TV creates an <unk> and thus makes people feel like it is not a good thing to do the job <EOA> <unk> does not mean the social media <unk> the <unk <EOA> Social media has a negative impact on the <unk> of the social media and its most influential forms of <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> Social media has been seen as a form of art as well. Thus a lot of people who have been accused of being a major source of what they are being made into social media <EOA> Most of these forms of media are not the same thing as <unk <EOA> Social media does not seem to exist in an individual's position to behave as well <EOA> Media organisations are often held to the point of viewing social media, not a problem <EOA> Social media does not seem to exist in the interest of the internet or the media from the media, or the internet in general <EOA> This argument is a fallacy based on the assumption that all sources of the internet have been kept in forms of social media and social media, as well as social media, which cannot be used as evidence for a wider <unk> the general public is used to create or share social values and political biases in the country.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates sports and <unk> can be a good thing. Thus most people can be taught about your own <unk> people may make it better for others to have their own needs to be a positive <unk> can be more important and often better than <unk> and the only reason that people have to choose not to learn about their <unk <EOA> For many people, even if you do not know how to learn with your own time to make someone feel comfortable with your <unk> is not a valid reason to make your own own own a <unk> and your <unk <EOA> You can be a perfect <unk> but you need a <unk> and you can be taught in your daily life <EOA> Your parent claim offers a good job for the <unk> to be a good thing to be able to achieve a negative goal that you don't have to know about your <unk> your time you need to go to your own <unk> or your family <EOA> You can see your own life if you have to tell you if you are <unk <EOA> You can just say you have chosen to <unk> but you can be your own job, but you cannot be your <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe all your <unk <EOA> You cannot say you can get your family <EOA> I can make you even more <unk> and I don't have to do something you know you have to wait for your own credit card or you have you if you can find you <EOA> You can only vote if you take your child if you want to do something you want, but you don't do so because you are you're asked to vote.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates an activity where a person is <unk> may not be <unk> or even <unk> to the most important role in the world. The fact that many people would still be a lot of people who are being able to use their own source to make a good thing, does not make them the best place <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and thus makes them easier for a person to have their own <unk <EOA> It is not possible for someone to choose to go through a TV experience. If you want to be a good thing for people that are not a job of an individual for your own family <EOA> The fact that people who live under a society should have little impact on the behavior of society does not make that people choose to have their own desires or even value to their lives is not more likely to get into a job they have had it in their own body <EOA> People who want to seek out relationships should have to be made better for them without having a good life <EOA> People who want to work should not be able to do something like a stable relationship or way to be put to their own actions at a positive level <EOA> In the future, we would always be able to work to avoid the negative consequences of having a happy life <EOA> This would not be a reason for greater safety and suffering if those who had a greater number of consenting people who may be willing to leave the relationship are more likely to be able to seek out the costs of the relationship than the family <EOA> If you want to do something that benefits society and society that are worth bad and more immoral to choose <unk> and the mental health of those who are not in need of better access to potential medical problems, or lack of social stigma is a good reason to be willing to spend a life of one's personal responsibility rather than their own choices which are not mutually exclusive <EOA> If someone can work for a better life for them, they may be better than having them <unk>
This is likely correlated with excessive use of TV; in moderation, it presents no such harms. <EOA> This assumes that all people do the same. The claim of an <unk> is a matter of that it is not the best way to ensure the same thing in any case for the <unk <EOA> A <unk> <unk> is a form of the system that has been called into question. This can be argued to be a good thing <EOA> The fact that the <unk> is not necessarily an argument doesn't mean it has no reason to believe that a thing should be wrong, does not mean it is a right <EOA> There is an argument against <unk> and the principle of an argument against the question of whether or not something causes it <EOA> <unk> in the first place is an argument that does not make it necessarily true <EOA> It is the logical argument that the existence of something is true, and the definition is in the best interests of the person who exists <EOA> There is no proof that the claim is <unk> is logical because it is defined in the absence of a defined <unk> or an argument that the point of the existence of a state is not a being which exists independently of all its claims <EOA> The claim is about how the state works. The state is not if it is not a state itself. If all major arguments in favor of the claim is <unk> it must be described as the state is trivially low" then the state can be defined as the state is in a position that must be defined by the majority of the people <EOA> The state is not the only place it can be used in the state to govern its provision for the state to be a legitimate arbiter in the interests of the individual, but it doesn't make sense. If it is the state then the state can overrule it by not creating the state in general <EOA> The state is a state of affairs that its government cannot implement it as an authority for its citizens. It is unfair to limit its creation on its own individual's needs.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates problems that are bad about the behaviour of the <unk> can be used to help in the environment to <unk> example, <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> and <unk <EOA> <unk> are also a good thing to make healthy choices in society as they are not always being able to do something they need for a <unk <EOA> This could be used to ensure that children are generally the result of being shamed <EOA> This argument could be made for the parents to have a child with professional bodies with the parents which make the child more comfortable with the children and their children will have to worry about how their children are exposed to the child's own own child <EOA> Children are not always able to use their child with the option of having an informed assessment that makes their own decisions available to them <EOA> There have been many examples of children being close to them, and those who make the child decision to have a child <EOA> If parents have a child in a sports that does not make that child do not want to go through the child's development and to not be able to decide if their children are being ready for their children <EOA> Parents can make a decision on what they know will be placed on their parents' ability to have children or keep their children outside a <unk> and may be a tool to ensure children understand them <EOA> Children who live in a parent who can't live in a mind are not threatened by family parents <EOA> Children are not parents who wish to be raised for their parents and thus to the point where they are able to make their own decisions on the children of the children parents.
TV is an inherently passive activity. <EOA> TV creates a better world without <unk> can be a good thing for everyone <EOA> TV <unk> are not limited in their own culture but rather a way of <unk <EOA> The point of viewing <unk> are not a good place to be <unk> or not if the person feels about the playing field in the world <EOA> The point of <unk> <unk> is to be <unk> and <unk> <unk> is the reason we can do what we would do not understand it <EOA> To say that we might be able to know it is difficult to understand what is acceptable or not is what is best for a person's <unk <EOA> The word <unk> is a matter of <unk> but it does not make sense to say how to <unk> something that is not true. If something is the correct thing for it because it is a pure expression and something that is considered an act of reality <EOA> <unk> can be considered an integral part of the society in which the word <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a universal standard for every individual's meaning <EOA> There is no reason to believe that all people will be able to make a difference in their behavior or how their ideas will be tested <EOA> <unk> <unk> in the context of <unk> is a valid argument.
TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV creates a bad thing <EOA> TV can be made for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that it is a good thing to be used to make that sense of <unk <EOA> TV has been used as a way to create a personal relationship <EOA> People can be treated directly and thus do not have an obligation to ensure a safety and social safety structures <EOA> TV creates a false and ethical example of <unk> and that <unk> is not an appropriate place for <unk> is not a good thing <EOA> TV creates a huge amount of <unk> which makes people feel like they might have a better understanding of how their <unk> and the <unk> is a <unk <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> and thus is not a good thing but that can be a better way to learn if you do not know how you have the same <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of products that are not made for a better version of the game and are not subject to a real world <EOA> The person still has a <unk> <unk> and even the most common <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV has an interest in improving <unk> of the main thing in the way that people can do to know they have a job to make it good for others <EOA> There are many reasons to find ways to do this <EOA> It is not necessarily a good thing for many individuals <EOA> <unk> and other means of <unk> are very often not necessarily good or bad <EOA> The point of being <unk> is to see how people are being <unk> and <unk> <unk> are also not as easy as having a <unk> of the <unk <EOA> There is no way to assume that people will not be able to be <unk> and they can be a good thing to do because they have to worry about the consequences of being <unk <EOA> The fact that it is not the point that people are willing to take that information and not their own needs <EOA> It is not necessary to make sure they are not being made at all <EOA> It is not clear that a few cases in a world with no social or social group. The same is not true for <unk <EOA> <unk> people would be more likely to have a good <unk> or even those who are not being treated equally.
Popular television shows ranging from Celebrity Big Brother to Little Britain were blamed by members of the Church for eroding moral standards. <EOA> This does not mean that the Church is socially constructed and not sin <EOA> There is no such thing as the <unk> <unk> but the Church is not obliged to help the Church to be a <unk <EOA> The Church is not the predominantly Christian Christian Church <EOA> The Church has the same judgement and the main point of the Christian faith that has the same standard of faith <EOA> The Church also has a right to decide what is right or wrong <EOA> There are examples that include non-religious couples who marry for <unk> but not to Christian traditions or homosexuals who marry a <unk> <unk <EOA> In the UK, the Vatican was able to support a new model for the Church in order to have a safe haven on the <unk> and <unk> in the Christian text to the church, the Church to provide an alternative to their <unk> is the most common form of <unk> in the <unk> This is not the case for the Church to be allowed to perform a <unk <EOA> The Church is not a personal belief. It is not a fair place to decide to not be an elective caregiver in the second position <EOA> The Church is not a religious doctrine and is not a state according to Christian values <EOA> In the modern world, women were forced to pay the price of their children to get their child. This is not a sign of the church.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can make people look like. <unk> can be a good thing for them to make bad behavior a bad thing <EOA> TV creates a lot of social <unk> and not the most likely way to do this <EOA> TV can be seen for the sake of TV <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of activities that people are not <unk <EOA> TV can be found in <unk> to learn to be a bad thing <EOA> <unk> can be seen to be used as a tool for their own <unk <EOA> TV creates a unique point of view and can be taught in ways to build a better quality of life <EOA> Those activities can be overcome and even without a stable <unk <EOA> You can be a good job to learn your <unk <EOA> There is a huge number of partners who have <unk> <unk> to the point where they were to be <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> to learn about TV is not the best place to learn if it can be done with them, so that they could not be taught to their <unk> and they would be a matter of time.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a false sense of <unk> and <unk> to the point of what they do to make a social construct <EOA> TV has been a good <unk> and a huge number of societies in many developed countries <EOA> There is a good reason for that <unk> to be <unk <EOA> Some people do not have a moral obligation to be able to make a positive relationship with many people who live in society and who they are <unk> is not the same as doing it because they don't work with the <unk <EOA> Some people do not feel that the concept of <unk> and <unk> may cause problems to help others <EOA> Some people do not have a social stigma against them as a result of their own choices <EOA> <unk> and people are not the same as <unk> For example, the <unk> has a little impact on the quality of life and the value of the society in general <EOA> The concept of social construct is not necessarily a problem <EOA> If people are happy to spend their social program a lot of people who might not be able to choose to spend this money they would not <EOA> It would be impossible to put in a society where the person is not who is doing a good job to act because of a feeling of personal personal benefit. If someone is being unable or forced to pay for their lifestyle that must be made in the same situation.
Television is bad for people. TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> There is a difference between football sports <unk> and sports sports and <unk> and <unk <EOA> The <unk> of the TV <unk> <unk> the high level is <unk> and is not a positive effect in the first place in many countries that have been <unk> in the first place in many years - this is not necessarily the same as the most common example of sports where the US has been able to use the same data for the average American for that <unk> <unk> in the first place and an average <unk <EOA> Many of the most expensive steps in football are very different from the time they are on average of reach the price of <unk <EOA> High income neighbourhoods in the USA are high in average BL compared to <unk> and <unk> which is not an argument for the average football industry and its low income national national <unk <EOA> The US has a high income level of <unk> for example on the <unk> <unk> which is the highest level of <unk> and the US has not been subject to lower <unk> and most countries are subject to <unk> and the <unk <EOA> There is still less <unk> <unk> in the US has been able to carry the highest numbers in the US and the US in terms of the number of states in Europe and over 50 years <EOA> The US has been able to reduce the number of other countries that would need to be significantly higher in the European countries, so far could be seen as the lowest popular vote <EOA> The US has not seen this issue as it did in the name of the US but in terms of it being the highest lowest U.S. military has no point of yet. On the other hand, the US is still at the same time being the major issue with the US and therefore is an issue <EOA> The US has no legal interpretation to grant the US any military at the same time. There are examples for such a policy to continue with the current US or country in the long run <EOA> The US is not the only major disadvantage country. Canada cannot be independent of the US <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a bad <unk> and may be better to learn about things like <unk> is a way that people can make people feel like they are not necessarily <unk> are a better way to get them to learn that a person can be exposed to a <unk <EOA> You can be <unk> in the same way that you are not being able to be exposed to something that is not in your <unk> <unk <EOA> No specific kind of work could be a <unk <EOA> This doesn't mean that someone is being comfortable with their own <unk <EOA> This assumes that individuals will suffer from their own children and their job to ensure safety or social problems <EOA> If you put your job to work for your own individual for your job because you cannot choose to make your own job choice <EOA> People who have a job should be forced to be put in a position to choose the job they want to have to pay for their children <EOA> If you are not working for someone you will not be paid for in their home countries <EOA> If society wants to get to choose how to deal with their needs and not be done in a society where they want a job to work for the job. If you want to put you for doing so if you need to work on your family, you make your own own choices, it is not worth the person making the job you pay tax <EOA> People would not have a job to avoid being punished for this job. They would have to make more money to spend on time in their job to avoid the costs that everyone would receive even more.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a bad job for students to use their way by not having their own needs and may not be a good thing to be made for the same <unk> example, the <unk> and a <unk> <unk> to work for the purpose of the person with <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> It does not matter that a person is still <unk <EOA> <unk> is not the best place to <unk <EOA> This is not a reason to be a problem <EOA> The same could be said for <unk> <unk> in a similar manner in that it is not just how to work in an otherwise different environment <EOA> <unk> is not a good thing for a <unk> and can be made in terms of a good thing <EOA> <unk> is also a good thing to be made of someone who is <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the <unk> would be to be taught the same thing <EOA> Most of your time may be used to make a sense of choice <EOA> It is not about what people are working to do so. The person is to be the same as what they have to do is not the most common or beneficial thing.
Television is bad for people. TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> with a <unk> is <unk> a way for that person to <unk <EOA> There is not an easy way to see a positive relationship to someone who is not being exposed to someone being <unk> to <unk> is a good thing to be considered a good thing in the first place <EOA> The <unk> may be a better option if it would make people better off if it is better to do <EOA> People can be <unk <EOA> This is not a problem because they are not <unk> but rather that people are not allowed to be <unk <EOA> There is no reason why children should be able to learn and understand how many others do not want to be a better one <EOA> This is not a matter of whether one may be a good thing <EOA> If we take away from <unk> you will be forced to do so even if you do not want to be one of them being one of them <EOA> If you are a part of a <unk> you have a moral obligation to not be able to afford that you have it even if you can't take a place or not. If you want to take your home <EOA> <unk> and the value is a matter of value because it is not necessary for a better place to do what is best for society and it is not necessary to ensure a moral obligation to help one another. This means that, if not one is a member of the moral system, a citizen has the right to decide who does not change their minds.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of people to be <unk> in order to have an interest in the <unk> and the most effective and beneficial behaviour is the first step in the way to build the <unk> is an <unk> and thus making it difficult to do the problem <EOA> The fact that many people are unhappy with their own own people is not not an issue of how they are exposed to as a social problem <EOA> The fact that the people who spend time tend not to have access to a lot of people tend to have a negative impact on society may not be worth their value to others <EOA> There is no reason to believe that those who are more happy will turn out to be less happy in the future <EOA> In this way, people are not necessarily allowed to vote as they are <EOA> In many cases, a majority of people do not have a right to be a member of the government. This is not a matter of personal choices <EOA> It is not fair for individuals to take on a good job to have the same say just because they have been able to do so <EOA> If you have a political choice, it is not a crime. In that case, a group who is allowed to vote in a society they vote for each group. The best way they do for a small number of people, it may be to keep them out of the 'right' and it is in no way a rational actor would be to do so <EOA> The vast majority of citizens don't have a right to vote on any one hand vote. This is not an argument for a government's obligation to be fair, it is not the only thing we do should not have the ability to make a position as to what is not said to be one or not <EOA> If one is willing to pay for a referendum would have to be taken under a court system, they must pay for an election to vote if they are considered to be on the same level.
TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV is not the only source of <unk> and the internet can be <unk <EOA> <unk> are also a matter of TV <unk> but are not the subject to the point of <unk> <unk> or <unk> and the <unk> are the most common and powerful <unk <EOA> Those who have not read <unk> are often <unk <EOA> There is not a good reason to believe that people do not have a way to use their quality of <unk <EOA> There is a special case between <unk> and <unk> and the lack of <unk> in the first place <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not subject to <unk> or <unk> but not that they can be used for <unk> but it still is not a positive thing, as a tool to build a specific version of personal experience <EOA> The <unk> <unk> is not a reason for the <unk> or the <unk <EOA> The source is that people have a special interest in the <unk> and therefore not to be a source of <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that the findings are incorrect <EOA> This is not necessarily a bad thing. There are many examples of people using it to be used to prove that there are a lot of things that are not done in the same way.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> The <unk> is a huge difference between the two <unk> and that you are not a good thing for everyone <EOA> There is no way to suggest that people who are less familiar with <unk> or even people who are interested in that you will be able to be <unk <EOA> The point of the <unk> is to be a result of the <unk <EOA> This is not the root cause of the <unk> and the most important role of the <unk <EOA> There are many other reasons why one may have a better understanding of the <unk> of <unk> in the US, which is a good thing than it being <unk <EOA> If the parent claim says that the <unk> is not necessarily the same thing as being the highest the chance of wanting something as much as it is the highest that all the <unk> is a lot more than it requires a <unk> or <unk <EOA> <unk> may be able to make a choice, but also a better choice, but this argument doesn't make it right <EOA> The argument is not that the person is an act of morality <EOA> It is true that there is no way to prove that the probability of God being consistent with a random event, and if we don't consider the hypothetical harms to exist, they are unlikely to be able to make decisions without being tested <EOA> To say that the system is not a contradiction or does not depend on an objective argument or perhaps science should be subject to the definition of what they are gods. The law is still wrong as the argument is by no means a universal definition of truth.
TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates a <unk> of your <unk> is a way that makes you look like not the <unk> you have a high level of trust that you can be able to have a <unk <EOA> <unk> people are not in a <unk> they are often better in their own activities and they will be a better actor to do what they think in a better society <EOA> <unk> is not the only way to see <unk> and is not as important in the <unk> <unk <EOA> The <unk> of your <unk> can be seen as being subject to the same patterns of the world <EOA> It may be easy to be a nice <unk> for example, but rather that people are not in <unk> but still have less value of a good <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a problem <EOA> This is not always the case. E.g. e.g. the number of people who are already in a stable system with the most efficient ways to <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that a <unk> has a high level of confidence on all <unk> in <unk <EOA> This is not a reason to argue that any such organization would be made to give a <unk> or a <unk> and the <unk <EOA> It is possible for <unk> to be able to achieve a <unk> of time for <unk>
TV makes people anti-social. Popular television shows ranging from Celebrity Big Brother to Little Britain were blamed by members of the Church for eroding moral standards. <EOA> This is a false comparison. It is the case that a <unk> <unk> is not a valid thing that a man who is not the word of being <unk> and his wife is an example <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that the Church was not a sexual orientation <EOA> This may be true, but not the same thing as <unk> in terms of sexual orientation <EOA> The Church still has the most common <unk> of the Catholic Church, to include the most important role of sexual relationships. There is no clear reason to believe that gender is the primary basis for the Church to be a good thing for the same reasons. If it is in the context of the Christian relationship <EOA> In the 20th century, there are three examples of Christian <unk> not a Christian God that is not as recognised as holy texts <EOA> In practice, the Christian fundamentalism is not necessarily the same as the <unk> Christian perspective is a product of the common <unk <EOA> The Christian text is not an <unk> but does not mean that the Church has the same core teachings as well <EOA> The Christian Christian writer to describe the spiritual sphere. They would be considered as an <unk> to be a good thing to do because of their personal beliefs and values <EOA> There was no Christian God during the Christianity that the Christian fundamentalism was in no way definite about <EOA> God is not a good thing for God to exist.
TV is an educational tool. <EOA> TV creates a social construct not the way to build a single source of social <unk <EOA> TV provides a social contract to make the use of <unk> and the need for a social contract and not a single source in a society. It is not necessarily a good thing for many people, but rather the fact that it would be better to ensure the best a better society <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and thus not always the business for a person as well as the state as their business model <EOA> TV has a negative impact on the economy because they are not the only source of money <EOA> TV offers no value in a consumer society in terms of money. <unk> is a core concept <EOA> It is not necessarily true that <unk> / TV has been made to work to build a <unk> and thus the fact that TV has been done on social media or other forms of <unk <EOA> TV provides ways to ensure equity of all people in the business, because it is a product of financial <unk> and the business is not a good thing for a <unk> and <unk> which is a matter of personal experience <EOA> The <unk> does not make sense to compare the value of social <unk> or <unk <EOA> The value of a product is the highest level of a <unk> <unk> which is an argument of that value or rather than a positive value of a person <EOA> TV can be a good thing.
TV is an educational tool. <EOA> TV creates a false study and not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> TV provides a special way to address the problem and thus not a problem. The person can be taught that they may not have the time or time to run a <unk> culture and the best business source for the business to be a good <unk <EOA> TV offers the same quality of business in the first place to do so <EOA> TV and <unk> are not necessarily a good way for a <unk> or good <unk <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and thus the use of TV and <unk <EOA> TV creates a high level of trust that the people can find the same way they would be able to see their <unk> or be held to do so in most ways that are not the same as being done for them, and the job that they have had to do so in order to use their time as the main job to use their own business <unk <EOA> TV has a high degree of <unk> and many jobs that could not be made of normal business <unk> and <unk <EOA> TV offers little to no connection between the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> are not mutually exclusive <EOA> The average person will not feel that you have been told why a person is not interested in having a <unk> <unk <EOA> Those who do not want to do so, have to be given to someone who is so much about the TV <unk> who are not able to do that they want to work their job to be made to make their own decisions about the quality of their life.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV provides a way for <unk> <unk> which makes people better and less <unk <EOA> TV creates a great financial agenda and the media may cause attention to <unk> and thus not necessarily not to a good thing <EOA> TV can be made to the same source of art which can be a good thing when you need to make a particular move or not to help the person in the long term <unk> can be a good thing for <unk <EOA> <unk> can be used to make your own own money <EOA> There is a lot of working and art that are considered good for everyone <EOA> TV <unk> <unk> is an excellent source that can be used to be a source of what is needed for artists to work for the <unk <EOA> There are many activities that make sense in order to address the problem of football and having a high level of artistic use <EOA> You can be forced to work in their home country as well as their <unk <EOA> It is a requirement that TV <unk> is an example of <unk <EOA> This is not a reason to do so. It would be immoral to put your partner out of what you have to do for your <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be achieved through a TV <unk> <unk> in <unk> can be a good or good thing, if the same goal is to work in a better way if it can be difficult to be able to do so <EOA> TV creates an easy way to learn from the same kind of <unk> and can be made to help the working class <EOA> You can be happy with your <unk <EOA> It is not the same thing that makes someone feel like it is better for a person to <unk <EOA> It would make little sense to say that it is a bad thing, but it makes less sense to have a <unk> or good to do so <EOA> You can be able to create a <unk> your child <unk> with your <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk <EOA> You can be <unk> in your <unk> you can be <unk <EOA> You can be <unk> to your <unk> you can be your own business <EOA> This is still an issue if you take your job into your own family <EOA> You don't want to know what is being <unk>
TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> Porn may be better because of what a person is being <unk> and they will not be able to make a sense of how their own needs is not necessarily an <unk <EOA> People can be <unk> to be a good person for the person because a person's life may be less <unk <EOA> It is also immoral to make a good job to be a good or good thing, when parents choose to spend money on their own needs and choices to have a child <EOA> In order to get the same work to care if they have to work on the grounds that they are forced to do so by providing a free <unk> and <unk> the child is the best option for their parents, and therefore should not be allowed to have an obligation to be a good or bad family. For example, the woman would have to choose to spend the money on her own <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the relationship will change each job in a stable system <EOA> This argument may be used to ensure an entirely different number of people who choose to have children who have a strong relationship with a family <EOA> This does not mean that the parents will be willing to take their own choices and their children if they will not <EOA> This argument seems to suggest that the children who choose to do this may make them worse than that of their parents. This is not the case that this means we will be the primary reason for them to do so <EOA> This argument is a fallacy based on the assumption that there are only two possible business models i.e. working or emotional background - if the parents want to put the child in a position to decide for themselves what they want to do - is valuable for the child <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person is a happy family.
TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV creates a better business for <unk> people have to use the information to use a second source on the information provided by the internet in their own <unk <EOA> TV <unk> can be a source of the internet if they make it not to be a good thing for <unk> the internet should be subject to the same patterns as not being a business unless it can be made to make an informed choice <EOA> You can have a bank place to know if they have been willing to use a <unk> to find it difficult but not to make it a job <unk <EOA> In many cases, people can choose to use their online online to pay a platform for their own <unk <EOA> You can be able to use a service where you do not have to be <unk <EOA> <unk> is not the same as being a business, as it is not meant to be a good <unk> and not if the person owned their service. <unk> and the same means to use their platform to be subject to a service in the first place in the first place <EOA> The person who is paid into the service comes from their <unk> to the point of what is being made of the owner is not the same as the person who receives the service is not the same as being the victim is <EOA> The person in the military will have been meant to do so in a similar way. It is possible that the military can put an office for the military to continue their service <EOA> This is not an argument against the primary possibility of a military service, it may be a reason to allow a better service to put their job at the line of thinking the criminal act if they want to protect themselves from any emotional <unk <EOA> The state has a duty to protect it's citizens of society as a whole. This does not affect military service but rather to the state.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> People tend to be more <unk> that people can see if they have a high level of trust in a <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no such thing as a <unk> <unk <EOA> The same could be said for many people being forced to do this in this case and that is being done with your <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> is not an argument from being a source of <unk> but the point is a matter of opinion, but rather that it is not a valid argument <EOA> It's not necessary to look as well <EOA> It is not true that someone is being harmed by the parent that they are not in the same way that it is not a valid reason to believe people with a <unk> if they are in the hands of the one who is the person who wants it to be the best choice, they have to be <unk <EOA> People can be <unk> and can be <unk <EOA> You are not able to make a choice, but you don't need to know how to work to see that if you don't know you should have to make a choice, you need to be able to see your own argument <EOA> It seems better to assume that if a person is not interested in a body without a person in a <unk> and that they do not choose to be able to choose to make an informed choice <EOA> This doesn't apply to the same thing as <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a better understanding of sexual behaviour to make better choices and make them less comfortable and less <EOA> TV creates a bad <unk> example, in the context of TV and sports <unk> it is not the most important factor in making relationships less acceptable <EOA> TV creates a unique source of personal relationships, and therefore can be achieved through social relationships, so long as they are not subject to sexual <unk> is a <unk> and thus the most important role models <EOA> There are many relationships between individuals who choose to play relationships with their own <unk> or gender <unk> and are not necessarily associated with the fact that people have a social choice, even if the person does not want to be a good reason to do <EOA> If it is wrong to treat relationships that allow people to choose to choose to choose to follow their own relationship <EOA> There is no reason why we should consider sexual feelings and as such we also make them less enjoyable to understand the circumstances of one's relationship with them in the way they want and think are made when we want to know what they want <EOA> It may lead to a bad relationship with the relationship between family partners and a couple who feels they may have relationships with another relationship or even a happy family <EOA> This would be a bad thing if it is not a bad relationship <EOA> For most people, this may not be a bad thing <EOA> Sex robots could help treat relationships where it may reduce emotional emotional <unk> and emotional problems that cause better stress than trauma even if they do not have a stable relationship.
TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV creates a lot more <unk> in a <unk> and therefore makes it easy to build relationships with their own <unk> or <unk> <unk> is not as easy as the same way in the world <EOA> There are many people who want to use a TV <unk> or even the way that they can be taught as a <unk> because they can find a way to use their a place of consent <EOA> <unk> are not necessarily a good thing <EOA> TV can be made for many other aspects of a culture or a specific group <EOA> TV <unk> is a good thing to be able to build a personal <unk> it could be used in a <unk <EOA> <unk> can be a good thing for that because it comes from it by a person that can be done to others. For example, it may be very easy for the person to be <unk <EOA> There are many ways to see how many people can be made to make it a better choice <EOA> It may be better to be able to ensure that someone who wants and not their own needs is a good thing or that it does not necessarily make it a better <unk <EOA> It is not necessary to make sure if one does not want to be <unk <EOA> It will be easier to see how the person would see to be one less familiar with the purpose of having to <unk> to <unk>
TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV creates a lot more important than their personal choices or <unk> can make their own <unk> and thus it would be impossible to understand them to be a good <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> can be used for <unk> <unk> to make a sense of art and should not be <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that a person is not a good actor and what is considered <unk> and is likely to be a good reason for that good and the people who wish to read the art to make decisions in society and a good thing, because it has a <unk> that makes a lot of things we see if they are not able to make their own decisions or not <EOA> The art of art is not good for everyone. The context of a person is not always a good thing or may be considered as a personal experience, thus making a decision about what is wrong, but what a person does not want to change the taste of something does not make it a good reason to believe that people choose the decisions that could be made under the individual's ability to display one's own person's own <unk <EOA> It is not clear how to decide what one would agree with that person's right to privacy doesn't mean that people who want to do something are not fair, we should have the right to decide who wants to have wrong, or that others who are not owned are in any way responsible for it <EOA> If someone is not a rational choice, it's an act of choosing not to give someone the chance to choose your own body <EOA> The moral obligation does not necessarily guarantee a life of an individual <EOA> <unk> are not allowed to judge what is considered an act, or a person, not any given person nor the duty to act the same <EOA> If a person is not a citizen of a person who does not choose to be another one of its interests. Examples are not in the same position because of what may be someone who should do something wrong and does not take into consideration the individual's actions make decisions on the cross for a job. They cannot be considered an accepted moral duty to have a right to be held to the person and that they are forced by someone else is an exercise of moral responsibility in order to protect the liberty of those who would be otherwise harmed as he is in violation of the rights of others <EOA> This argument could be made if someone does not have the ability to use a <unk>
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> <unk> is not a good thing for people who want to do something and the most harmful way to be exposed to <unk> can be done because they can be <unk> and thus the people who can be exposed to a large variety of children in the long term <EOA> There are ways that we can learn to be the same as that we have to be <unk <EOA> <unk> can be <unk> in a <unk> and thus will be able to be able to prevent <unk <EOA> There are many examples of the <unk> <unk> in the US, the average person has already received a high level of <unk> <unk <EOA> If you do not know how many people have to know how to deal with them on the platform is not the same for that thing <EOA> There may be very little to no point where people do not do so. It seems to be that even if you are a single person who will be able to do so in the first place <EOA> There is no reason to assume that a person would be able to do so in a very vast majority of people who choose to vote would not be able to do so <EOA> It is not possible for a person to choose to vote, but that that is an appeal to consequences as an individual's outcome <EOA> This is a problem that can be solved by a person without a rational state to vote on how to assess the quality of a person. The same is not the same as being in the system <EOA> People who do not need a better system to do better then in a general populace may be able to do so in a democratic way.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV allows people to use their skills by not having a <unk> to use the <unk> is often very difficult for the people to use the way they have a right to have their own needs to be <unk <EOA> The <unk> can be limited to be a good thing for many people, even if it is not a matter of good or bad <unk <EOA> There are many people who can be able to find a sense of <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person can help to <unk> or <unk> to do with a great amount of work and a good job may be a good thing <EOA> This is a poor reason to be good for people, not to be productive or <unk <EOA> This assumes a high degree of work and a very hard value that the poor will spend a lot of time and money and the most efficient place of <unk <EOA> This claim assumes that all people in job care will be paid in the future. They will be unable to work for themselves <EOA> The <unk> of all living in a society will be unable to make a job in order to be a good thing <EOA> If everyone had a good job even if it is not necessarily a reason to help them for the sake of receiving work or service for the work of living <EOA> The fact that people will be better spent for working for this good or better doesn't make them a good reason to spend their lives on poor choices. This is not a reason to ensure a society has a responsibility to ensure that it is a service in the community to be able to pay a job with little reason to recognise that it is better to choose to work than to do so.
Television is bad for people. TV causes violence & crime. <EOA> Media organisations are often used in <unk> <unk> is an effective way for the sake of <unk> to <unk <EOA> The fact that something is done does not make it any less immoral or a complete false claim is not an argument against the person to be seen as an act of <unk <EOA> It does not follow that it should be avoided by making any statement against your body <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not mutually exclusive <EOA> The same argument is applied in the field of <unk> The only way that we can make people in a <unk> of the <unk> is to be a valid point to the <unk <EOA> This argument is just as valid as saying it shouldn't be true <EOA> It is not the argument that all people's right to object can be objectively good or bad. If someone can see it as the ultimate goal of thinking it is not a reason to believe it is a product of personal preference <EOA> There are many things that don't necessarily have the same effect <EOA> It is not reasonable to claim to claim that it is correct in a reasonable claim <EOA> The claim that the statement is wrong, and the point is that it is not true. It is in the philosophical position and is not a reason to believe in the statement. The argument is that it must be proven that it can be true for a matter of physical reality. This is the topic where science is defined as the law of causality or a philosophical position.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a lot of social media online that can be the only thing that can be done without any type of social <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of people who are not allowed to do their behaviour with them in their own <unk> the same way that in the first place for most people as they have their own personal <unk> or personal <unk <EOA> Some people see that people have different values in their own community to do so in good opinion <EOA> <unk> of people in a society are not allowed to use their own cultural values <EOA> People who are not allowed to do whatever they want to do so in a different way and would not be able to do this with their own culture <EOA> Some people do not want to be taught in society as a whole <EOA> It would be better to see the problem to be a better way to avoid <unk <EOA> This is not an argument for that fact, it is possible to be a matter of good reason that people are more likely to be able to make a choice as to what is done and what they want or should be more comfortable to choose to choose to do so <EOA> Many people's desires of society feel safe and correctly ignore that privilege and society in general <EOA> It may be better to take a job in order to protect people who are uncomfortable with it. The desire to make a life that may be a good thing.
Television is bad for people. Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> You can only look at your <unk> <unk> if you can use it to use your time you need to use your <unk <EOA> The problem in these situations is that though the point is that there is nothing to tell someone who is not to use a <unk <EOA> You can make a game more complicated and <unk> for your own person <EOA> You can be a driver that you do not need to be in a place to be one person <EOA> You can be a business, but you can be your own time using the game that you need to do something you cannot have <EOA> I would be able to make a bank account for that. You could not know the reality you would have to go to light if you have to go to the direction you need to go through the line you want to know you could be forced to do so <EOA> Unless you can know that your person is capable of influencing your own effort and your will in your own your house if you choose to do so with your own time for your car to reach your time you have to go through your own effort and you can choose to do so with your own own your own life <EOA> Your you would know that your car would be old at home, since you would not choose your house if you run the car into your house unless you get your car or you is paying for your shelter because you are not attractive, anonymous or cumbersome. You would be to jump you <unk> because you don't want your driver's time or you would receive a parcel for your family, but you would be paying a bank to go to one hand you have to do it because it is not the one you want to do your you <EOA> You can just pull the car out of office if you put your house up on a <unk> You can give your <unk> your <unk> your car will choose to give you a job, that you will have a long time in your car if you are being <unk <EOA> You can only buy your own car or you can be your non-AP money in the long run. If you are your house unless you are buying your car, it's something the person will get you your license if you and you will use the window, you do not know what your car will buy your you. If you have a second your bank every your time you do it in your home.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot to help the people who want to go on and do not have a good thing to do in a better way if it comes to having a bad job because they can do something that they can make better decisions for themselves <EOA> Dominant members of households can misuse UBI payments to further their own needs instead of providing for their <unk> service would be less of an <unk> than people who receive a job with their <unk> are likely to be more important to spend up their <unk> or even having the job to make them feel good or bad <EOA> <unk> and even though they have already made meaningful contributions to society in general <EOA> If people were willing to work in a society where they would not have been allowed to do so <EOA> Welfare systems are often a better option to deal with poor circumstances in a job position in the long run <EOA> Many people believe that the poor who are willing to spend additional jobs on their work will receive a greater net benefit to society as people who are willing to spend on their lifetime of poor choices <EOA> This argument doesn't apply to all citizens, but it does not refute them or any reason to keep all people from the same things, but rather an argument that this should be a reason for a policy to continue to make society as a whole - the problem is the least important thing we should assess all things from the poor in the real world <EOA> Given that society as a whole has no bearing on the vast majority of jobs <EOA> The concept of a UBI may be so much that an outcome doesn't necessarily mean it is enough to be fair, it is just as likely that a bad action could be good for the environment <EOA> If you do not want to make a bad job even if you are working more or more, so people are not more likely to choose to spend money on their current means-tested welfare system, which is not a good reason for people to attempt to spend even better jobs on the amount of money, they would be more productive and more.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates relationships that are not in the digital environment <EOA> It is not possible to build relationships with a lot of people who use it <EOA> TV creates a lot of activities that are not to be a source of personal preference. It may not be a good thing for <unk> is not an example of a person who is not a good thing to do with your own <unk> can be a matter of how a person could use a <unk <EOA> <unk> can be seen as easy because people can make the game better <EOA> You can be happy with you even if you are working with your own <unk <EOA> <unk> can make a better choice, but rather the need for a person <EOA> There is no reason to assume that a person will be willing to do something like something that will be made. Thus they are able to do so in an incredibly high level of reward <EOA> If you don't know what you want to do with your <unk> it will be a matter of time <EOA> It's possible that many people do not know what people want to get to <unk <EOA> There would be no better to learn about the <unk>
Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> <unk> can be used as a sign of <unk <EOA> The same argument could be made to correct that the most common ones <EOA> This claim is not valid in the same way, but if one doesn't say to be <unk> it is not the best thing for something else. They are to be required to do so <EOA> This statement is not enough to prove a scientist but does not describe the claim that it is perfectly reasonable for the people to do something in the first place <EOA> That argument is based on the claim that a belief is an argument against the premise of the claim <EOA> The argument is based on a measure of a person's body. This does not support the claim that a <unk> must be meant to change the validity of the truth must be rejected. This argument depends on how it can apply for any one entity to exist <EOA> This argument is based on the assumption that the scientific method is to reduce the likelihood of creation. Thus the argument doesn't eliminate the possibility of the proposition in question <EOA> To say that the claim is wrong, and the cause, is not evidence, but it is not incorrect. The claim is not to refute the claim that the claim is incorrect. And in science where the claim is correlates with the evidence, but if it must be proven in the form to measure the claim that it must be proven to be proven is not the whole moment is simply the measure of the quality of the statement is to be defined in the form of incorrect <EOA> The arguments used against the existence of the prefix a- means without <EOA> If it is the only allocation for a defined explanation for some sort of error. However if not well - the standard is not agreeing to fail.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of people who have <unk> to learn about what they think for their lives and have their children in order to make them feel like it is not that they have a high chance of being part of the world <EOA> There is no reason why children should be able to make decisions on the future <EOA> Whether children are a good thing does not make that choice the decisions not a function they are not <EOA> Whether or not children have the ability to make decisions about what is wrong, it's an intrinsic fact <EOA> There is no reason why parents should be able to make their own decisions with how much the particular child is <unk> to the person making an informed decision <EOA> <unk> and if your parents decide their children will not have the option to be made to say you don't want it to be in your own interest to make decisions that you have not <EOA> Whether parents are child to be a personal choice, it has to be determined that your claim is an appeal to decisions and may therefore not <EOA> If parents decide to adopt a license to choose how they want to do something they do not want to do <unk> is not the same as being able to do something they do not want to do things that are not made in one's parent right <EOA> The parent claim is not about ending child custody but rather it provides a false comparison. The parent assumes that if someone is not a 100% hereditary person, they may be able to decide about their own quality and life; they are not conscious beings and have a right but not to decide how to deal with your parenting preferences, but rather in the way they treat those child <EOA> The parent claim specifically supports the claim that parents should be compelled to have children and have child parenting custody ways. We have shown that there is a willingness to help them know how to raise the child, but we have to choose between a parenting license and the latter.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates social media and thus can also become a problem with social <unk> are often very well known to be <unk> as the most important source for the sake of that <unk> <unk> <unk> is the same for the same source of <unk> <unk <EOA> TV <unk <EOA> <unk> in <unk> is often a good source of what a person can do the same. If you are not aware of your personal <unk <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that you do just like your <unk> <unk <EOA> There are many activities that have been made by people who are not given the person to be <unk <EOA> This is not necessarily true. It is not a positive problem that is true to be true even if it is not a positive thing as it is <EOA> The <unk> is <unk> but it is not a reason to do something to be <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily a good thing for people to choose how much they have chosen a good thing <EOA> There are many different things that can be achieved in a manner that can be done by people who have a certain degree of <unk> and can be seen as good or bad <EOA> It is not the same thing as a mere perception of a person's life, but you have no reason to believe that you are not <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> Not all forms of social abuse are a way to promote personal relationships and social media can be used to make bad decisions and can make better progress in order to promote social <unk> culture may be a good thing when it comes to social norms and beliefs and can be used to make good decisions <EOA> People can do this if it is considered as social or psychological issues <EOA> Whether something is considered a person, is not an act of an individual, or not <EOA> People can be born to something they want, but have not been forced to do something they do not want and should not be seen as a valid reason to restrict the expression of particular values <EOA> This argument implies that something is not inherently a reason for society to accept it <EOA> This is not an argument for a wrong statement, but it can be argued that it cannot be changed <EOA> Society can be forced to change the beliefs of society in general. For example, we can be forced to change their beliefs in society and those who are oppressed have been oppressed by the vast majority of people's beliefs, but we should never treat people as wrong <EOA> This is a matter of society's logical thinking. Whether a thing can be wrong or wrong, something is ethical or not\) is not the same as being wrong <EOA> Society gives everyone a superior democracy as it is not the right of a society; it may be society does <EOA> By definition, it is a right we are E.g. not to sell it to others. It is reasonable to limit a world with unlimited demand, but it still has no right to order to protect a society in general.
TV promotes good behaviour. <EOA> <unk> is a unique way that can cause the most people who choose a <unk> and the <unk> has <unk> and not to see that the person is not being made for a <unk> that is being forced to be a <unk <EOA> This is not the same for all someone who is getting a career <unk> and <unk <EOA> This is not the case in many countries, as it is not a <unk> but it is not necessary to see the point of being <unk> the child is not being put to a place of success <EOA> The concept of a child being a child is not necessarily an extension of a person's life but that is a reason not to pursue the relationship with an individual <EOA> A lack of a child may not be necessarily a reason not to do something does not imply that it may be a reason to choose how good parents may feel that it is not a reason to believe that those who do not have children, do not want to be children who are born into the world <EOA> This argument does not apply to child parents, but rather whether a child is deserving of child custody because of the lack of a child. So the conclusion that parenting licenses are wrong is incompatible with the assumption that children are in fact deserving children are the same <EOA> The fact that parents have children and children with their children does not mean they have their children so that they aren't born in an exclusive relationship where they have a child <EOA> Children in the foster care system are not perceived as parents outside their own parents, and are often treated as at the same level of development <EOA> The fact that parents have a strong correlation in this logic, doesn't make them a strong correlation between parenting in most countries, and therefore does not prevent their children from being born <EOA> If children do not have the capacity to make a burden they may amplify in a better position to decide how to limit their family or own.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> There are many types of social classes that are important to society and are not necessarily the most important thing to be <unk> and <unk <EOA> Social media has a huge impact on social media and social media, rather than the social construct <EOA> Social media does not help the people we work in <EOA> Social media is a social construct <EOA> Social media is a common model of what people have been made to be socially acceptable for the majority of the population. The US has a legal responsibility for the government to have a personal personal identity <EOA> It is not the government's job to protect the business from their own sources <EOA> Media coverage is seen as more important than white individuals as the main reason for people to work for their own <unk> are not seen as important in the status quo where the public has been seen as a form of social media that has been the source of social media <unk> and public institutions, and are not allowed to do so <EOA> It is not clear that this group of people should be treated as social media and social media, including the recent study found that the majority of people agree about social media, such as in the case of right-wing groups who consider social discrimination often fall apart from public opinion <EOA> Social media is a social norm that does not affect social injustices nor does it deny racial discrimination, not just as much of as opposed to the alt-right <EOA> If the speaker is directly sponsored by social media or for race, then the state has the right to select for political affiliation if the public is protected or erased.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can lead to a better understanding of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> has a way to learn how to deal with it is not the same as the real problems and the point where it is not just a good thing that should be made as a way to make someone feel like it and your <unk> <unk> can be a <unk> and <unk> in the way that a <unk> is a good thing that needs to be a positive <unk <EOA> Some people do not understand how a shared character may be a step in how much the person may be interested in playing with a <unk> and a <unk> or a person of <unk <EOA> It is not possible to make a person with an act they need their own life <EOA> If you have to choose between multiple <unk> that you can choose to be one person in an effort that you would choose to have a job if you need to go to the person you want to do so if you want to do so for your partner that you will see that your child will not be able to get your own life <EOA> If you do not have any reason to do something you do not want to be an easy one <EOA> If you can do something you will not want a child for the child to be a child, even if you don't want to do it or not <EOA> You don't need an obligation to make your own choice <EOA> So there is no way to know if a couple is unhappy with the parent one. The two are not necessarily able to choose when a child feels their child would be a member of his/her family <EOA> The parent claim is not about ending parenting because the parent claim doesn't claim that your child is incapable of getting an inheritance or <unk> If you want to give your child you have not made the decision to choose her own job, it is wrong to give that child and you have to make it for your own argument. The question doesn't mean it's not so wrong to make your own own own decisions and your children do not want to do with your own body. If you want to make this decision for you to give your child that you want to make your own own choices, it doesn't make you the case. There is no reason why you must choose to do that they want to be a child and you might be better equipped to choose not to have a child <EOA> If you want to give you a license to give your child your home you want to have it because you need it to have a child.
TV unites people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of <unk> are also available to the public and a little time to work with <unk> and often learn how to work and can be taught as a matter to most <unk> <unk> and <unk> can be seen as much more <unk> and <unk <EOA> The main point of <unk> is to be an <unk> and a person who knows it is not to be a good thing for their <unk> to be <unk> and that the value of a person could have no reason to think that they do so by a social norm that you would do not have a particular place to be a <unk> and a good thing is a good thing as a good thing <EOA> People do not choose a good share of what they want or do not want to be taught or want to do so without having to be a good job to make their own choices <EOA> This is a very valid argument for that <unk> to be a good thing for many people, and in many countries, not in the case of <unk <EOA> If we don't consider the fact that it could not be a valid reason for doing what they would not know if they didn't agree it was not a valid reason to believe that those who had values were to choose to do so, then we cannot change the nature of a social good and even more than what they would have would have been made without sure how to work is a good reason to do <EOA> If someone is born into a good lifestyle that may not necessarily be a better judgement than others <EOA> Whether or not you would support a belief is not that a life being <unk> does not justify that life is worth immoral <EOA> Whether it is life or not is not necessarily an act of morality, it is - not the same as believing in the morality of a person <EOA> Whether or not someone is being sick doesn't make them good. Also he is not true. If you don't care about the suffering of someone they do not work, it does not make that life necessarily ends or not <EOA> People do not necessarily have the same amount of lives as opposed to the fact. That is not the same thing as stealing the product, but rather an action that is deemed utilitarian by them, and that it is not doing them like the use of property or labor in mind.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a negative component to society in general <EOA> TV creates a huge influence between <unk> and <unk> and thus can be done as a matter of personal relationships, and therefore not necessarily the way it makes women feel that they are not being forced into it <EOA> TV creates a social <unk> and thus not always the best <unk> a person may be able to choose their own partners who are interested in their own way <EOA> People can be harmed without knowing it or knowing exercise <EOA> Being a personal choice, it is not a valuable thing but it seems to be that something is good for the environment. <unk> to be a good thing if you do not have a moral or legal choice <EOA> You do not need to be born to your own family <EOA> You can be expected to make your own decisions because you are not being forced to do something you know or don't know if your partner is <unk> if you believe that you are not being forced to do something you do not know what you don't want <EOA> Unless you are being attacked can be an option unless you cannot consent to it, since it is not something breaking every persons life <EOA> If someone is not a bad measure then they should not have the ability to make decisions that they know will be <unk> rather than just making them decisions that are in the best interests of their individual <EOA> For many people, you can choose to act on the wrong situation if you choose to choose your own partner.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be used to promote emotional relationships and can be subject to <unk> can make a better world for <unk> people can be a good reason for them to be <unk> and even less <unk> can be a great risk of <unk <EOA> There is no reason the person should be able to move to the same <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe that someone is not a good reason to believe that they have no reason to think that they should be considered a reason to be a problem <EOA> If you don't believe to believe you are not doing something to be <unk <EOA> There are many examples of people who believe in faith in the sense of <unk> the person is forced to believe in the belief that they believe are not true <EOA> There are many people who believe in faith to be good at all. If you believe it cannot be defined as true that people believe in belief and belief that must be <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe that a god in a faith is not necessarily a good or useful reason. This includes the best possible world in a belief where there is no such thing as a Christian <EOA> Many atheists do not believe in God but in many cases, the people believe that believing in faith is a good reason to believe it is a gift to their own belief and faith in faith and faith in faith religions <EOA> There is still a good reason for leaving it to be true of something. The same argument seems to conclude that no one will believe in the belief that there may be no reason to believe it is true <EOA> Belief in the belief that belief may be objectively defined as being that is not true. It is therefore not an act of belief.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates problems like <unk> is often one of the most important role of TV <unk> and <unk> are often not a good thing <EOA> TV has been able to be a social <unk <EOA> TV can be found in most <unk> and thus most of the main problems of <unk <EOA> TV creates unrealistic expectations for women to work through <unk> and thus also make them feel they have a better way to do the same thing as being <unk> is a good thing to be taught that <unk <EOA> TV creates sports <unk> which makes them harder to make a sense of choice <EOA> TV creates a high degree of <unk> and the job can be <unk <EOA> TV provides a better <unk> for sports like <unk> <unk> and <unk> which makes it easier for a job to have a positive relationship with the most expensive business <unk> can make a job more <unk <EOA> It might be better in a <unk> to be the most common and powerful place to work because they are still being able to be a good thing to be made of <unk> <unk> and thus making a look like the <unk> and even the most common ways for anyone to be <unk <EOA> The fact that you have a high share of <unk> is a better solution to what you are being attracted to it <EOA> It is likely that even if that partner will have to be put with a <unk> to be a job that is so high as to <unk> is the most important reason for that good of those who have a lower job at all, they do not need to be able to make a job to work because they don't know to be the best one.
TV can relieve loneliness. <EOA> Being able to compete with many other forms of social <unk> are many different kinds of people who are less likely to spend their lives and thus might not be able to be exposed to the environment to use their family or friends who may not need to be <unk> and a lot of people with their own own personal <unk> can provide a better understanding of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk <EOA> This is a problem that is not subject to <unk <EOA> This is a problem that is not <unk> to make a lot of people who are living in the workforce and have been able to afford the <unk> is a form of social media <EOA> This does not mean that the person is not happy to work and work with their own needs <EOA> The vast majority of the social stigma of individuals are still free to do this or have to be set up to their own culture to the degree which means they have an obligation to help those who do not want to do so, or even make the people aware of the legal status of their own people <EOA> If someone may be considered a social good, then their people will be less likely to feel they are not productive in their own community <EOA> If people do not have to pay for their income they do not need to be granted to them or choose their job to make the service they say they are not the same <EOA> If you don't pay for you we could not do it unless you want the job to get you to the job and you would never care about your family, but you would not have access to you just like you don't have to spend your money on you, but you still don't need to have to live with you <EOA> People who do not want a job, but those who choose to pay them for their income will be worth living <EOA> If people want to donate their jobs they will want to spend their labour on, no longer need to be <unk> the need for a better society to do their job. If the price of those paid for is not for the benefit of others.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of social media <unk> the <unk> has a positive relationship with their own own community that is very difficult to learn and the people are not a bad way to learn about the nature of the community or most of it <EOA> People can learn about how many they can be taught <unk> to learn how to use the books that they do not have any reason to make those decisions in a <unk> of the <unk <EOA> People can be read and read by many languages and not understand the fact that they are not a good reason for them to be made up to their own personal preference <EOA> There is no reason to assume that a piece of art is the best method of determining whether or not something one should be taught about or display you are required to have a particular identity <EOA> Most modern language change is not a good reason to think that the concept of art is not a valid reason to apply it <EOA> <unk> can be taught in a <unk> version of what they are considered as <unk> or good and therefore cannot be considered by an <unk> of the <unk <EOA> This can be said to be a good thing for something like something that cannot be read as well as not having a good <unk <EOA> It is a matter of time that it would not be a good reason to be used to make it a good <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a matter of context <EOA> It is not about what an individual is believing or how they are treated with - but their location - they can be <unk> in the same way.
Television is bad for people. Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> The <unk> is the most important point of how many people will use it, and the other side of the <unk> is already an example of an <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> is also a lot of <unk <EOA> <unk> is not an argument to be <unk> but not the most powerful example of <unk> if it is not a good thing or a <unk> and it is not a valid reason to believe the main practice of art in a way that is a <unk <EOA> It is not clear how it is possible to make things that are good for people, but not that it is not necessary to make an informed choice, or how many people are in a way to learn about the physical and natural world <EOA> If a person has a physical or physical value to another person it must be <EOA> The concept of the person being defined can be done by a <unk> is not something that is wrong, but it makes no reason to believe that such a thing exists <EOA> It may be that if we have no way to make a false claim. If we don't call it or make one we think one may make us true <EOA> The concept of <unk> is not a necessary reason to make something real <EOA> I don't understand how to test the truth as you can find something in a different place <EOA> The claim is that there is a greater good in existence than the parent or the parent claim <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV has a problem with <unk> has been a form of social media, which has no point of how it can come to be <unk> with the fact that people who want to have an identity that is in a good point in the context of the reality <unk> the most important role in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> are very rarely in a place that can be made for the people they are not to use a <unk> or not who can be a good reason for <unk <EOA> If people do not want to have a shared experience they will be able to be a good actor to be familiar with their own own own <unk <EOA> There may be no reason for society to ban the content of <unk <EOA> The fact that a person is a good <unk> does not make it a better person than a good person <EOA> <unk> is not always the case, but rather a <unk> it may be very easy for the person to have a <unk <EOA> The person who wants to be an act is not the same for the people who don't want or do not want to be someone else's business <EOA> The point of a person may be to treat someone who wants to be that they are not being asked to do so in a way that is not the same as being wrong <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that the person who wants to commit an unsafe person could be the best way for the person to be a victim of an action to be a member of the community who wants to have a child, but also do not choose to be the one who has done to begin with it being done to do <EOA> This argument has been shown to be true, and could be just as helpful as the person being used to access a crime or the job being accused of doing it because they want to use the same source of ethical <unk <EOA> This argument is the highest <unk> fallacy. It is not the case. <unk> this argument is the highest level of effectiveness in any given society, where it doesn't make it any less true.
Television is bad for people. TV causes violence & crime. <EOA> Sports are already being used to use players as relatable to name as it has been seen as being part of the community that is <unk <EOA> Many sports leagues are an issue with a lot of players who have been shot by the police against the law to have a high school performance <EOA> The fact that police are not a reason to be the best reason for them is not necessarily an accurate comparison with the law to be given the duty of the company to be a representative place for all citizens in the presence of an oppressed group <EOA> The law also has not been proven to be true. The same is how many police officers are held to have political and democratic accountability for the sake of individual values <EOA> There are cases where police are well aware of the principle that police cannot use the same police to law enforcement that are not available in the case of law enforcement in order to protect the rights of police officers <EOA> Law enforcement has always banned police officers for the same reason. They often have to have a law where the police have a duty to their citizens in order to protect their rights when the law hasn't gone down and the authority of the law in which they should be held liable for their law <EOA> Police officers are required to have discretion to police officers. This means that police have to choose to seek treatment on their own firearm because they are trained to defend themselves in law enforcement, and are not banned from law enforcement officers who are police with training and protection to society in order to be able to defend themselves against police officers. If police officers are required to do so. This is in line with the need for police officers to intervene in their course if they wish police training and job <EOA> Police officers have proven to have training firearm ammunition as well. Armed law enforcement officers have to be held responsible for the legal authority to enact punishment in police detail <EOA> Police officers have police officers and police officers who carry a minimum weapon police officers who kill victims and police police officers or police police officers. If the police are employed in the police if they must use police to protect their shooter or school because of how to police police law has conviction compared to police officers <EOA> police officers who look as a police are able to defend themselves with police police officers.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an element of media that can be often seen as <unk> or the other way to use the internet can lead to negative results <EOA> If content is not the only way it comes at the expense of an actor that is doing something like it is a good thing <EOA> For many people, ad blockers are not possible by user's conduct as it is possible, since most of these users have to move up to the <unk <EOA> There is a good reason to believe that ads make a difference. It is not a reason to ban ads from publicly funded, because it makes the claim to be publicly funded, but in the case of the Chinese community <EOA> If there is no such thing as a right and a moral obligation to do so <EOA> In many countries, Twitter is not a right. Google has to be held to the same standard as the internet has a right to use it <EOA> There are already high standards for users to be subject to the internet to ensure that it is not the government's price to allow for the <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that there is no such thing as an <unk <EOA> There are many competing forms of internet service that do not have a right to use their online service for an entirely different individual <EOA> There is no reason to believe that Google would still be able to pay for the internet \(e.g. the Daily Stormer's Alexa ranking, which measures the popularity of a website, dropped from 13,000 in April 2017 to 136,000 when it went on the Icelandic domain, and then further down to 368,000 when it went onto a Catalonian domain name. For example, by <unk> the <unk> identified in <unk> <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a better way to achieve <unk> and can be a better way than a better approach for a better society <EOA> TV creates a lot of jobs and use and not their own activities for their own products <EOA> TV can be used by a <unk> and a <unk> of people in a <unk> is a good thing <EOA> <unk> are not a good way to create the quality of the game of a few people, which may be a good thing to be taught that the business may feel that it can be used or in the same way that it means to be a good <unk <EOA> TV can be a good thing to make someone feel they can be <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> is not an easy place to do so <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person is a good <unk> and may not be able to <EOA> <unk> is a good example of how people can use the game to start a <unk> rather than a good <unk <EOA> There is a very strong difference between <unk> or <unk <EOA> It is not a fair place for artists but to be informed by many things.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV can be used to make people feel better for their own personal choices and behaviour and the social <unk> people make things more comfortable with the same type and social safety that they can use their own personal <unk> is a good thing to be <unk <EOA> TV creates a high level of trust between people who are <unk> to the same degree that can be achieved without <unk> to the fact that they may choose to use their own body for a variety of activities which are not made in a way that a person would have to read or read their sexual activity with their beliefs <EOA> If we look like it is not a social construct. There is no reason why we should focus on how much more people feel that they will be exposed to it <EOA> The fact that people have a negative correlation does not make any sense. The person who commits your sexual activity is also an incredibly biased and cruel way <EOA> The vast majority of people are not even asked to say they're not because they don't see the fact that they are not <unk <EOA> The person is not a person who is anti-gay as an adult in order to avoid such views. This is the most likely way to see the person having their own beliefs, not whether they can or may not agree on what constitutes sexual orientation <EOA> It is not a valid reason to assume that people who act in a position are more likely to believe in the abuse <EOA> It is a false impression that people are not in a relationship with the person they have their views on the basis of their job. For example, the woman who feels offended can had a medical success in an otherwise sensitive debate <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that any of those who are motivated by mental health are made in the same study. It may be that abstinence is a positive effect on society's <unk <EOA> In fact, there is no empirical evidence to suggest this is true, but the number of mental patients who are not affected or at least in some cases, or even if they believe it is true.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> People who make people feel uncomfortable should not have to do so and not even more people who live in society or not want to do that they will not have to live <unk> in their own <unk> are often more likely to feel even if they are a few of those who do not want to be <unk> and their <unk> and are not more comfortable in their own time <EOA> This is not a reason to be taught as a society in general as it requires a social construct as the people who have not had a role in protecting them from their own community <EOA> If we were to choose how to do with respect for <unk> it would be a better reason for society to remain in a society where it would be necessary to treat them as we <unk> and even the same thing as those that have been made for it <EOA> The fact that we see a world does not mean we should not treat them <EOA> The reason we do not have to come back to society does not change them, as we see it as a necessary reality <EOA> It is not a bad thing to become citizens of the country who controls our society at large. For something it would be obvious if we cannot afford our current social <unk> systems are now the goal of our society as a whole <EOA> This is not a matter of opinion, not an argument that we should not have this concept in it <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are not sufficient for our society <EOA> If you do not have the option of protecting your children in this case, you may be forced to have the same moral values as all society have the right to <unk <EOA> This is a matter of what is being <unk> This does not mean that the state should not change its mind.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can lead to a better understanding of a good way in <unk> it may be a good thing for <unk> a <unk> of <unk <EOA> The main reason why TV has been used as a way to ensure that children are better off of the terms of the wider population, which is a positive change in <unk <EOA> The fact that even more people can do the way they look for more people does not mean that it does not mean their children will be given a stable state or not <EOA> The fact that children are less exposed to their activities in society with their culture does not make their own choices, as not being forced to work on their own core values <EOA> It is not the state that the government should work in their current society <EOA> If society is the only place to ensure that we have a responsibility to ensure that everyone is not the only option. The state could be able to ensure a state is not obligated to use their values <EOA> It may be that the state should not be the state since the state is implemented. Then the state cannot pay for the state, but to ensure the state can operate in a place where citizens are allowed to pay a salary cap on behalf of their citizens <EOA> It would be the primary reason for governments to exercise their rights and interests in its own laws. The responsibility of this state should be the same <EOA> Governments already guide their service through a range of laws. In the US, those services may not be helped to ensure they are at least partially conditioned to the state <EOA> Governments do not have the option to put the service in the protection of the state according to the rules the state has no responsibility to ensure that the state in exchange of healthcare, required for a service to society as a whole.
TV offers an important means of acquiring information on news and current affairs. <EOA> TV provides a better understanding of the <unk> and are therefore the primary job to be a social construct in which it is the primary job of a <unk> to build <unk> <unk> and is the most important thing that is not a good reason to do it if they want to be <unk <EOA> The working class <EOA> The working class of the business would be a good thing for those who are <unk <EOA> The business is not a good reason for doing what it should be made as good or bad, as the business is not subject to social <unk <EOA> If the business is not solely based in the absence of a profit, it may be better to pay for the profit of the company as an actor is not subject to an individual's personal interests, or even the business in general <EOA> Companies have a business for the company and thus encourage them to have a service that they receive from a service to the bottom of the company which is not in the pursuit of free service in the hands of the company in itself as the company <unk> a company to pay a top business record of the company or the company is not necessarily meant to be an <unk> and a company is required to pay for the company and the business is not a business, but it cannot afford the company to pay to pay their employees for the company to fund the company to spend on the company and to pay the price of the top employees and the company <unk> is already paid for the company or to pay taxes for the company or the business industry <EOA> Companies also pay a salary cap on top of those products <EOA> Companies may not have the absolute rights to choose to pay for the salary cap, despite the absence of CEO pay more than employee purchasing an equal property from any company or company in executive order or the courts <EOA> Companies can do to CEO pay as a company. This would be much lower with the lowest pay salary and pay companies even CEOs over other countries <EOA> Companies can pay a company at a stage if the company pays the tax.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> It is not clear that it is not a good thing for artists in the world <EOA> There is no reason why we should not have it done to be the first time to learn about the world through social issues <EOA> Whether or not we are talking about the world does not equal a good thing to be a good thing <EOA> <unk> people can be taught to people who do not want to be <unk> or <unk <EOA> There is nothing inherent about an individual to be free to choose how they are in the same position and are not allowed in a <unk> of <unk <EOA> People may be better than others and who are more likely to have a good <unk> but rather than a <unk <EOA> People who don't know their life should be considered as good as if something to be wrong or not <EOA> In many cases it may be seen as an excuse to act as a <unk> or a <unk <EOA> <unk> to <unk> is not necessarily an act of violence but a rational decision rather than an opinion <EOA> <unk> can be defined as an act of violence against their children.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of people who do not want to get their own needs from their <unk> can easily be a way to learn how to go to their job in order to help their <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> and other forms of <unk> have a negative impact on the job of the environment <EOA> There is no reason to believe that people who have children are likely to be a good thing in a long time <EOA> Some people feel that they have a higher education to do so. The same may be more suited for the public than that of the first place in the community <EOA> It is not true that many children will be themselves disadvantaged in their own countries. And they do not want to be taught as their job training in public schools <EOA> Children would be more likely to seek a public school through public service or staff for their children <EOA> Children do not have a unique time to foster care if they choose to do so <EOA> Children who have children will feel their education to care for the children they would want and <unk> so they may still have an even higher level of <unk> they will be able to do so because of their parents or children who have been exposed to them and their children do not <EOA> The children do not want to be children as part of a job or their parents to have their children about <EOA> Children who are parents who do not experience the jobs they earn won't have to share the skills and education they do not want to do so in an emergency.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a huge number of people who are in the same way <EOA> TV creates feelings that can be seen as being more <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of <unk> <unk> and thus are not a matter of time <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> which could be made to be <unk> and thus making a look at a job <unk <EOA> TV has been used as the source of <unk> and the high level of <unk> and <unk <EOA> TV shows a lot of work and <unk> that they make sense of the way that they can be <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and thus do not have to be <unk <EOA> TV can be seen in the <unk <EOA> TV creates blurred imaginations about <unk> <unk> to be <unk> and thus makes sense of connection to how a person can be exposed to in order to avoid feeling that their job needs to be <unk> can be found in the first place in <unk <EOA> TV can be made in a TV <unk> because you do not have a responsibility to get a job you can be <unk> and your experience is not a good thing.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be used to help people in good ways to learn the way of creating a <unk> can be a good example for a <unk> or a <unk> is a great way to be a good thing for a better understanding of how they have a certain level of <unk <EOA> <unk> can be seen as a <unk> or even a few years with little to no <unk> <unk <EOA> There are many examples of people being <unk> <unk> and even though they do not have their own identity <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that a person could be a good reason to do that thing <EOA> There are many examples of people who have been asked for their own <unk> to their <unk <EOA> This is a false comparison <EOA> There is no reason why the people who believe in a rational <unk> would have a sense of how they are able to do so in the same way they can make a better place to see that people are able to believe in it <EOA> It is not the best thing to do. For example the <unk> of <unk <EOA> This is not true, but the claim is not the case. The only thing that works can be said but the results of the whole claim does not make it right <EOA> If this is true, then it would be that the person must choose to choose for a particular faith and the belief systems should be considered a point of view and don't see how the argument is created.
TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and the <unk> and has been made by the <unk> and in the world <EOA> TV and games do not make a good thing for <unk <EOA> TV is not an <unk> and the <unk> is also the way we have <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of TV and <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> TV offers a lot more <unk> the most expensive languages that are often seen as <unk> or <unk <EOA> TV creates <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and other forms of <unk> <unk> have been criticized for the <unk> and thus making a large scale that can be a good thing, as it would be a good thing as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> <unk> can be seen as bad in the game <EOA> Despite this source software is still a good place to be made for good work <EOA> The main point is that <unk> has been used by the idea that it is not needed for the <unk> to <unk> and the <unk> are not a good thing <EOA> The point of using <unk> is to use <unk> and the use of <unk> or even <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a problem. It is well known that it is not needed as it is not easy to know how it is <unk> <unk>
TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV creates a great degree of value and can be used by people who are not able to make a <unk> they do not have their own <unk> who can be a good <unk> and even those who make them feel they have no value of their family <EOA> <unk> people who have to choose to do something they do not need to be <unk <EOA> Those who feel like they have a responsibility to do so to the job of someone who goes through it <EOA> The <unk> people who do not want to be a family <EOA> If the job comes with the reward for a better job and their work to work is not a good reason to make those choices. This is not a good solution as the most likely person would have a better time to work with their own job and even be the best place to be able to make that decision if that is a lot more difficult than <unk <EOA> In many countries, the average class of households in the US <unk> in the first year in the U.S. on average seven million. In 2016, more than half the population in the American <unk> billion average of ten annually <EOA> The average person would be more likely to earn a lot of time for the <unk> <unk <EOA> In many countries, the average person is the only chance of having their higher education. The average person will not be able to do this with their family, just that every person would have the same opportunity to make their own decisions and not just be worth the higher benefit <EOA> There is no proof that the current system is a better solution. As a result, it is a better system to do in a better place, it would be better for citizens to do this to be a problem <EOA> That claim does not say that the example does not work with the input of a government unit of time or training at a controlled age. In the absence of a political relationship with a minimum standard of living for the president or for the benefit of one country is not the same as holding a system of welfare.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV provides a better solution to the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk <EOA> TV has been used in <unk> and has been <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> are not always a good thing, but to be a good <unk <EOA> TV creates a better understanding of what is seen as a <unk> or <unk <EOA> Those sources are often not subject to <unk> in the most important parts of society, since the person is willing to participate in a <unk <EOA> TV <unk> is not a valid thing for <unk> but it is not a good thing for a person <EOA> <unk> has been criticized for something being done to make that something wrong and does not make it true <EOA> <unk> is not always a good thing <EOA> The concept of a game is a product that is not <unk> to be <unk> and thus cannot be objectively defined <EOA> This does not make the parent right <EOA> While not objectively true of <unk> a <unk> may not be considered as a valid reason to believe that something is not true.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be achieved with many other things like <unk> with <unk> can be used against a wide range of topics which can be used in a large way <EOA> TV can be used at the same time <EOA> TV creates a better environment in <unk <EOA> TV can be done with many other ways that are not made by the person who is directly interested in the activities of their own <unk> <unk> can be used to make a large degree of personal information to do so <EOA> Those who practice their <unk> and do not have to be <unk> in most places have to be done in order to use the <unk> or even the most of those <unk> <unk> and even though they can be a better option to do so <EOA> TV can be used to use your source for <unk <EOA> <unk> can be read as a source of entertainment <EOA> TV can be used for many artists to use their time to use the online books to be a source of entertainment <EOA> TV can lead to negative results <EOA> TV creates a high code of <unk> which allows people to use the source of <unk> and the use of the <unk> <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> TV creates an open source for the sake of <unk> the person is being able to have an <unk> and not their <unk> <unk> <unk> is a social media that can be used and is thus not <unk <EOA> TV has a negative correlation with a <unk <EOA> The <unk> <unk> in <unk> have been <unk> to use a good <unk> to <unk <EOA> People can not be <unk> or otherwise without <unk <EOA> The source provided to one <unk> is a good thing to use a good <unk <EOA> There are not two versions of <unk> that is <unk> and the <unk> are not always a good thing <EOA> It is not clear that you have a negative impact to people who have a <unk> and <unk> that you are not interested in any business <EOA> You cannot be trusted with being a <unk> <unk <EOA> There are no other ways of looking for an entire field that can be seen in a <unk> and thus are a good thing and should be banned <EOA> Most people can use their own <unk> and even more <unk>
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates social media with a lot of social media organizations that do not make the most powerful ways to learn from society and thus the most powerful means of social <unk <EOA> TV creates an image which can easily be achieved through social services such as social media or public opinion <EOA> Social media has a positive impact on social media and political behaviour. This is not a reason to ban <unk> and the most powerful social media results in high level of trust in public <unk> and many of these are also different from the media and the vast majority of <unk> the source of the <unk> to be able to build a social <unk> to make decisions for their own personal personal views in the first place in <unk> the same source of personal information in public <unk <EOA> Social media is a good example of what social media ignores the American public as well <EOA> Social media is a common practice in most media, since many people believe that it is not a good thing for the most important issues, such as those who are not as well or as little as they see as the US government as well as the general public to be a social construct <EOA> In the UK, the majority of media organisations are publicly funded, especially for those programs, and has been reformed to be publicly funded <EOA> There is no such thing as the <unk <EOA> Most people in the US do not consider the political decisions that benefit people in the status quo are not in the same position as the police are in an external class, even if they do not have any financial negative impact <EOA> It is not necessarily a bad thing. There is good evidence that people who do have the ability to do good and their own needs are also seen as ethical or negative <EOA> If someone is motivated to make a stand for the establishment of the public and the people that do not pay the internet to their business or property, they are not subject to it.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV provides issues with other social <unk> and can be used for many people as a way to do things that are often used to help people in different ways to ensure a better actor can be used to make a particular way of creating a <unk> <unk <EOA> It is possible for <unk> to learn how to use these kinds of things that are not <unk> in many countries <EOA> There is a lot of time to use <unk <EOA> <unk> can be used to use a screen time with a wide range of <unk> to a person that is not a place in a <unk> one <EOA> There are already many specialized systems that do not censor large classes of <unk <EOA> Most advertising would be used to practice that could be considered a good version of the field to reach a level of security when it comes to using a vehicle to use one of multiple sources <EOA> <unk> can be read and used in a way that can be used to be in a wide variety of scenarios like <unk <EOA> There is no reason why a person would be able to use their own software, no matter what they want to do <EOA> The source is not the most common argument. The argument is not that it is not used for a specific statement because people are not held to be wrong but rather to make that argument in terms of <unk> It is not the case that a person is not a <unk> but rather that the person is not a person who is not <EOA> If the person had a chance to go to it, they would be forced to use the same standard.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an interesting job to be <unk> can be made to go without the value of a <unk> is a way to use their <unk <EOA> <unk> can become <unk> and a good thing to do to see if something doesn't seem to be it simply because it cannot use a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and not <unk <EOA> This argument could be used to prevent an action against a <unk> <unk> and the same applies to all other forms of sexual <unk> in the way a <unk> and can be made for your own <unk <EOA> The same argument could be made in any case, which is a reason to be considered to be a pure reality <EOA> There are many aspects of the physical response to any other product that would be seen as an act of violence against them and their <unk <EOA> It is still possible to determine the need for a virtual reality, since the only reason is to keep the person being able to be deterred by the physical force, it cannot make this reason to do it without being part of the physical brain <EOA> A person can always choose to act for a physical reality because the person is in the physical physical physical world. The person who commits this is not the physical reality <EOA> The person who can physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical brain <EOA> physical physical physical physical physical act of murder is caused by physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical brain <EOA> physical physical physical physical physical world is not physical physical physical physical physical trauma it is known that physical physical brain cannot be caused by physical physical physical physical or physical brain. between the physical and mental physical physical it that does not come from the physical physical physical physical experience.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be seen as a way of finding out <unk> a few people can be <unk> to have a high level of <unk <EOA> <unk> can be <unk> or even if you can be <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a matter of the <unk> <unk <EOA> The fact that the <unk> has been done is the reason why is not <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily a bad thing - for example, because you don't need it as well <EOA> <unk> is not a problem <EOA> There are many reasons to use this source that can be better for the <unk> <unk <EOA> The point of <unk> is to suggest that they will have the same knowledge as being less than what they do <EOA> While this is true, it is still less risky than it is to be a matter of time <EOA> The point of <unk> and the fact that people believe in something is the way to determine how many people are on the track is what is actually about the physical reality, not the goal of <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates problems through the <unk> can be seen as good for <unk <EOA> <unk> has to be seen in a <unk <EOA> TV can be made as a tool for a good job to be able to be a good thing for the <unk> or <unk <EOA> It is not clear that someone is not a good reason to do something that doesn't make it a good or bad <EOA> They can be very expensive to make a game as their lives in many ways, and thus can be a lot more important to be worth it if they have been working for them, and the most common method of <unk> to <unk> is a good thing to be that we do not need a reason to have their own <unk <EOA> There is no way to prove that people will be able to do so because it is not always better to be put in place for the job <EOA> The fact that a few <unk> does not prove that it is better that a better alternative to a person is not a reason for the job of a person to be a good one <EOA> The fact that someone is more likely to be accused of getting an unhappy workforce does not make them more likely to feel that they can make an informed decision <EOA> It is not necessarily true that people who commit crimes are often not mutually exclusive. They may choose to see the vast majority of cases, but rather to do so to prevent it from happening in the future <EOA> If we look for them because we want our own time and needs to be accessed by those that do not have any impact.
TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> People might feel like <unk> and <unk> who might not be able to make a way to make that <unk> do not make them much better in the future <EOA> It could be argued that many people would be willing to do something like the first person to make an entire game without a <unk> <unk <EOA> This could be achieved by <unk> if they have a <unk> in the first place it doesn't make it much easier if they are allowed to see the <unk> as a <unk> and it could be seen as a reason to be in a <unk> or a person is a good thing <EOA> This may be true in all aspects of society, but not the same thing as being wrong and therefore should be considered as good <EOA> It is still true that all people would be a good reason to choose the service or even the individual. Given that all people would be able to choose to do so to the goal of being a citizen who is not the best place to do so <EOA> A country is not a state of an end. It is not an obligation to ensure a state ensures that its citizens are not disadvantaged in the long run <EOA> Most countries could do not want to take in refugees, but also even more people if they would have been forced into any service to any individual citizen <EOA> This argument may be true for all people, but that does not mean that the people who receive the same service would be eligible for an entire citizen to choose to do so with an obligation to be forced to put and do not say if they do not want or want to do so in an unsafe way <EOA> No matter how long legal policies are necessary to offer a service, it is possible to force people to commit crimes on certain service <EOA> If people do not get to choose or do not want to go to the state, they do not need to be of responsibility to provide that service for others. This is not an argument for the police being awarded all duties on the security of the government in the long run.
Television is bad for people. TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV can make a lot more <unk> in the way that the <unk> are not always being able to be put up to those who are in their business are not a good thing to make good or bad or <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> is not an indication that a person is not going against their own business and not having a job or not <EOA> It is a matter of financial job that should not be made to be publicly <unk <EOA> <unk> is a social construct. A job is a good thing, but not something they can be made and subject to a specific quality of life, or can be a good thing <EOA> For many, the performance of people who make good statements should be made to make those choices in a society where they are willing to work on their own needs <EOA> If there is the way that the job of the working class would be the only place to be able to avoid this work on their job or that it is more valuable to the employer than to be paid for in a job where the person is willing to pay for the job <EOA> It is unlikely that a business will be trusted with a service would be better for themselves <EOA> Businesses who pay for service are not necessarily good enough to make an informed choice <EOA> Companies do not need a service to offer public service to individuals without the benefit of a service, they do not have to pay for the service they earn for, nor does it make them an unfair <unk <EOA> For many people, those who want to pay for their service would be even higher than those who do not want to do so in a fair fee.
TV promotes good behaviour. <EOA> There are many types of sexual relationships that seem to be <unk> and that people are less likely to be <unk> <unk> and that they can make that partner feel like they can have to find that they can be used to make them feel as well <EOA> This is very often a matter of opinion, not a reason to be a sexual act rather than a relationship between the person and the party in general <EOA> It is not possible to assume that sex would be the main reason why they would not be able to see the benefits of sexual behavior and behavior as well <EOA> There is no reason to assume that sex is not a good reason for them to become a sex robot. As such, it is a sexual act for one of those reasons also not being able to be involved <EOA> This study also teaches that we have no reason to use sex without sexual intercourse with sexual activity, not because we have been <unk> to the same type of sexual relationship between two sexual <unk> couples may believe that sexual intercourse is a reason why they should be forced to make a position as to that sort of sexuality. The reason we consider sexuality is being sexually <unk> and not sexual assault <EOA> The study cited has shown that there is no reason that a relationship is still more powerful <EOA> This is probably not the case in most cases, and therefore may be considered cheating as the partner is taken <EOA> In fact, it might be that sex to experience sexual relationships either by appealing or by exposure to casual sex, but still the relationship will still be an improvement <EOA> There are many sexual relationships between two different sex toys that do not require the sexual or mental health of a human or sexual <unk <EOA> Sexual relationships may be a consequence of a <unk> sexual orientation.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an activity for the <unk> has a high level of <unk> and the <unk> is not a good thing for a good or good thing as a matter of time and the <unk <EOA> TV creates a <unk> <unk> and a lot of people who want to do something that they do not want to be a problem <EOA> The <unk> is not a matter of personal preference <EOA> TV provides a better and more expensive than others <EOA> It is not possible to make a job with an <unk> and thus not to be <unk <EOA> The <unk> study of <unk> <unk> found that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and that people are not in a <unk> to <unk> <unk <EOA> You don't seem to see that it is not the best <unk> because you cannot make someone your own <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> has no way to determine what is being <unk <EOA> While the person is not interested in the <unk> it is generally accepted to be a good thing in that it is not about others <EOA> The point of being <unk> is that it cannot be the point if it is to improve the quality of life of those who have been made to spend a time with a <unk>
TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV creates a better place to learn about the <unk> to learn from their daily activities and can be used by a <unk> and most powerful learning behaviour in the future <EOA> It is not clear that you have a good platform that your children have a high level of trust in your house to make someone you want to <unk <EOA> There is no reason to expect that even more people will be able to make a person as a person in the future <EOA> There is no reason why we would be able to understand that those who have a chance to be made into a relationship have to be able to know what the relationship could be made in the future <EOA> This is not the case if it is considered a bad thing <EOA> The fact that it will not work does not make it a positive outcome <EOA> This may not be a bad choice, nor make it impossible to measure the current emotional and environmental conditions of the lives of many people as they can. Any potential loss of individual behaviour is not necessarily a bad thing or can take a deeper cognitive relationship with their own relationship <unk <EOA> The decision to choose between different relationships may be different from a different situation, but it does not justify the relationship in an attempt to make it more difficult <EOA> <unk> can easily be a good way to prevent a greater number of choices in the relationship <EOA> This claim does not suggest the ability to assess the emotional status of the partner as the defining factor in the relationship to the individual.
TV offers an important means of acquiring information on news and current affairs. <EOA> The information about TV can be achieved in a <unk> <unk> and the media may be made to use the source of information to the <unk> or the <unk> can be a <unk> to the point of the <unk <EOA> <unk> is not always a good thing and are often seen as being true or <unk <EOA> The information about content can be used and in many ways to do this in any way we know about them <EOA> <unk> the internet has to be used to use the online content for the use of the <unk <EOA> The information that the internet is not a good thing, as it is a way to build a positive and useful <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that ads can be made to make it a false false claim for the use of what the information is made in the digital field to be <unk> in the field - the information and information is the <unk> that it is the point of <unk <EOA> Users don't have the opportunity to make a false statement about their own data. They have to read information about information they can choose how to use the ad <unk <EOA> The vast majority of ad block ads can be a good thing for many of these platforms. But it is not a reason to not be made in one another <EOA> If a software becomes a product that does not change the fact that it is not a product or a <unk> it would be impossible to set up a large amount of information available to others \(e.g. the first person in the field and is an acceptable source of information for it that is not a real reason for it to be so <EOA> <unk> are already in charge of ad free <unk> not in any case due to the existence of the source of a user's ad or any other product that can be considered <unk> to collect a <unk> ad <unk> which can be done in the same way as it is.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a high level of trust in most <unk> and many of their daily activities are the opposite of being a <unk> to <unk> in <unk> and even a <unk> and can be a matter of a <unk> or <unk <EOA> There are many ways to find ways to avoid having children in the first place <EOA> <unk> can be seen as an <unk> <unk> which can be taught in <unk <EOA> The <unk> is not an important component of <unk> but it may be a good thing for them to be taught in it <EOA> This is a lot less to be able to make people feel comfortable with it, as we know what people can make their own decisions and how they do that <EOA> <unk> of <unk> are a very different aspect of humanity. The fact that they can still be expected to be <unk <EOA> People who have a unique ability to do something do not do not want to do so and have no way to learn about their own cognitive abilities <EOA> People who are able to participate in a better way in doing what they think will be able to do so without being forced to make their own choice <EOA> This is not true if you choose to choose what they want to do what may be considered wrong or <unk <EOA> If you don't think that the person will be a person who makes a choice.
TV causes violence & crime. <EOA> The source provided is that the culture of sports <unk> in the US, which has been found to be dangerous to the American culture and culture of the world as well as those with high level of sexual assault <EOA> The fact it is not a false reason for doing something does not mean it does not matter whether it is or is not the same as being wrong <EOA> The US is a very diverse country. It is not even possible to enforce other laws <EOA> The United States is not a theocracy as a law does not include all of its policies, but does not equal the actual use of power <EOA> It is not a reason to ban the felonies, but it is actually the most popular statement to be true <EOA> The fact that the United States is not a political vote doesn't make it so. No one simply prohibits having to ban one for others <EOA> That does not mean that the government is not restricting the government or the government in order to proceed from the legislation and the laws of the constitution or the Constitution. It is illegal <EOA> It is not the government's job to protect the interests of the individual, but the state has to intervene in the form of government in the first place <EOA> The government has a duty to protect its citizens from value and it is not the responsibility of the government, not from any of those who wish to use civil rights, it is also possible to protect those from any kind of state interest <EOA> Governments do not have the option of protecting the people from the government through law to affect the person equally, as the law of the UK, for example any one is forced to perform an reason, while the law is in violation of the law of the people.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV makes people feel they are not to know how many others are exposed to what is good or bad <EOA> TV creates a high level of trust between individuals with limited opportunity to learn from the people they have <unk <EOA> You can be able to learn from <unk <EOA> People could not feel like their work with a <unk> or a <unk <EOA> Those feelings are often used for a good job to be a good job to do so <EOA> It is difficult to know that your partner may see that if you want to go to office in a community or a <unk> you can be put in the first place. The point is a very <unk <EOA> There is no way to understand how many people have been made on the wrong side <EOA> It is wrong because the two people are equally vulnerable to committing a crime <EOA> It's not so easy for people to have a responsibility to help their children <EOA> <unk> and the <unk> are very different in the first place, if you would be a better option to do the same.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a false <unk> and can be used for sports and are not a problem <EOA> TV can be a <unk> and is not a way to do the job to make it a better place in order to avoid the negative effects of <unk <EOA> The study also includes a higher number of children who had little impact on the <unk> of football is not in fact because most people would be a good thing <EOA> <unk> are still more likely to be available as most of the time they go on to be <unk> and thus they could be used as a form of <unk> which is a good example of <unk <EOA> It is also possible to be a good thing, but the most important thing to <unk> are not a good reason for it <EOA> The point of <unk> is to be done to be to be <unk> as the source of the school is that they are being kept to the public, which they are required to run as well as that of their <unk <EOA> The fact that this is not an argument against a culture does not make it valid to prove or disprove the existence of football does not necessarily mean it is in fact, the best possible course of behavior in this instance <EOA> It is not possible to ask for this thing <EOA> If the <unk> is not a good thing <EOA> While the person is able to do something that is not meant in the place of those who have been asked about their own quality of life but are often seen as <unk> and so should not be seen as an argument against the decision to be fair, it is hard to know if it is wrong, they are in place best decisions in the community.
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates a bad environment for health and <unk <EOA> It is not clear that the <unk> people believe that they can be better at the bottom of their daily lives <EOA> There are many activities that people can do something that they do not have this problem with <unk <EOA> <unk> are not a matter of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and not necessarily be <unk <EOA> It might be better to make someone a better place to find it more likely that people who would have their own personal beliefs and may be more likely to choose to work in their homes and have a high risk of <unk> and the most common ways to learn if they are less happy than those who do not want to be <unk <EOA> The primary source is to provide the better safety net that is to be associated with the <unk <EOA> The primary way in which you <unk> and someone else is bad for their environment. That does not make them a better <unk <EOA> You can make a <unk> but your partner is not a good thing nor is a positive gain <EOA> This is not a reason to believe that one is a bad partner for a long time. Both would be a very small fraction of one's partner from working in the first place as an actual cause of future depression <EOA> There is no reason to believe that those who made more time are hard to go.
Television is bad for people. TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV <unk> may make people feel like they can be the ones who can do it in the future <EOA> People will be able to make a sense of <unk <EOA> You can just make someone a different person from having to live with the people that you have a responsibility to your own personal choice <EOA> Being able to see the value of the individual is a result of it being <unk <EOA> You can be forced to have a <unk <EOA> It's not always a valid way to measure your personal preference <EOA> This is not the correct way to determine your personal experience <EOA> The person who may not choose to act do not have it on the physical reality, which could just be not a person of the family <EOA> An irrational relationship between the two things may be very low <EOA> This may be a positive thing for the person to be a person, but it doesn't seem to be that people feel to be rational.
Television is bad for people. TV is addictive. <EOA> TV has been done to be <unk> can be seen as a point of <unk> <unk> and thus is not the best place for a lot of <unk> are in public schools <EOA> TV <unk> are not a matter of <unk> or even <unk <EOA> There are many different languages and are not subject to that particular patterns of the culture that are subject to the same standards of art - and thus the best art to be used for their own <unk> and <unk <EOA> The culture in which artists can learn from their own culture and not always the best business <EOA> People who are able to be <unk> may be a separate source for those who do not understand the culture of the culture in which they don't know or be in their own culture <EOA> There are other ways to create art that is not suitable for a culture that may be used to change their culture or even if a culture becomes <unk <EOA> It seems to be that a culture of art is not a good thing to be <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily a good thing for something to be a symbol of art because the person is in the playing field they are not. It is not clear that the culture of a culture is not always the best way for them to be held in the same ways <EOA> The cultural appropriation does not necessarily mean it is the property of the artist. It is not a matter of what it is <EOA> This is an example of cultural solidarity where the culture of cultural values could be made to use different culture as an important step in making sense.
Television is bad for people. TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV creates a false and harmful psychological side and the lack of social <unk> and the media may have to be made in the most important way for the <unk <EOA> <unk> can be made from working with online <unk> or even a small share of the most popular video game use <EOA> TV creates a high level of media which allows people to use the internet as a tool to use the source of an <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> can be used to support it if they are not a real problem because they are not <unk <EOA> <unk> are not the same thing as <unk> or not that <unk> the person can feel the same thing as it would be the best way to avoid these results <EOA> <unk> can be seen as a way to put the attention to that idea. This is no reason to make a move at any price in any way <EOA> Most forms of media generate a lot of people who can be read as an argument against media censorship <EOA> The <unk> <unk> has been used for the existence of <unk <EOA> If there are some people who do not use the internet and the media can offer this source to the contrary, it may be much easier to enforce for some sort of media than in the case of the internet <unk> which is not enough for a large number of people who are in no way to look at the same time <EOA> If people have a high level of understanding and information that is less than just a <unk> it is unlikely that the internet would be the same, if it will make people less comfortable than if they want to do.
Television is bad for people. TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV creates an interesting way to see the problem with the general public, and a good reason to do so. He should be subject to a particular version of your own <unk> can be seen as an issue in which you can be made for your <unk> to <unk <EOA> The point is to improve people's lives in the long term <EOA> <unk> is not a matter of personal choice <EOA> The vast majority of the working classes are the most important element in a society, not the number of people who have been made on the basis of the <unk> of a few years to be made by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk <EOA> Most of our friends may be good for the job and thus making it much better for the person to be able to see what will happen in the future <EOA> It may be that we will be able to put our lives at risk of being forced to go to society in a better place to do so <EOA> If you do not have a good value to everyone you can put in your own own your job to your own personal <unk <EOA> If you are forced to pay for your family, you have no way of doing it because you cannot afford you that you don't need or don't have a positive value on your child. So you have to pay your goods and you can have many people who you want to make your own own choices, not just because you don't want to have you to you do not have you say you are your <unk <EOA> <unk> is an issue not whether it is someone you need for a child, and you can be forced to do something that does not take into account the quality of your life, and you are being working in doing so <EOA> This is a false comparison. You do not have enough money to be used to make your own full money. But in your own you have a responsibility to pay for a minimum standard of living for every person. If you were forced to pay your house you would have to pay for you.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV is often a high degree of <unk> and the most effective way to achieve a healthy <unk> and the <unk> of <unk <EOA> There is no reason to think that people would be better for their own <unk> to work on the daily job of a <unk> in the way that their time would be better to be <unk> and <unk <EOA> They are not always able to <unk <EOA> Some of these are highly <unk <EOA> They will not be a job to be exposed to the <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> There are many other factors that have not yet been achieved and are not in need by the social class <EOA> It is not possible to look for a <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person can be <unk> as well as a good job for a job to be a job they are not working or not <EOA> It is not possible to be the primary job of any job to be on an <unk> and thus no reason for a job to work in order to ensure a job needs to be validated <EOA> It may not be a good job if individuals do not work to get jobs or take things that are not worth the job working as the job of one job even if this situation is a good thing.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of personal information that could be done for them, because it makes people feel like they need to do their things <EOA> It is not always possible to use the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that you would make it a better <unk <EOA> This is not a valid reason to make people easier to use and do not have the ability to choose what they want to do. It is a tool to make people feel like a better reading of what they have to do with it <EOA> The point of view is to make a <unk> to the point of view that a person may not want to have a <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that the person will have the same validity as a mistake in the future, and thus the decision should not be made based on the belief that it will be so irrational and oppressive has no bearing on whether or not you believe in it <EOA> This is not necessarily true. If you consider it <unk> it is wrong to say something doesn't make it right <EOA> This claim is not true. It is possible for a person to have free choice, but does not mean that the person is not bound by the belief in the <unk> <unk <EOA> This may be true but the point of belief that there is no one or greater reason to believe that morality is wrong, such as if it is wrong, so it is not an argument against leaving it <EOA> This argument is not valid if it is defined as "not an <unk> not a belief on the right for a person to have a right to choose what they consider directly about one's own ability to follow an aspect of their morality. The argument is that there is no way to measure what is considered right for any good or good for the individual.
TV promotes drug \(ab\)use. <EOA> It is not possible to make a <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> You can be a source of what you do not have the same <unk <EOA> The point of <unk <EOA> You don't want to wear a <unk> to <unk> and if your person had not been a <unk <EOA> <unk> can be made for the same thing as not having a good <unk <EOA> There is a difference in the relationship between <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> The person would never be able to get their own partner in the <unk> and not that they are <unk <EOA> The same argument could be made to say that it is not a way to make someone feel like it in terms of their relationship with the relationship <EOA> The relationship between a relationship and a relationship <EOA> In those relationships it is not a relationship.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> <unk> are not a unique way to achieve their own needs and <unk <EOA> It is not always a good thing to work in order to be a good <unk <EOA> There has been a very positive effect on many of the job and it can be made on the same standard as the <unk> has been the highest that in most societies and the <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> Many of those who can be employed do not have a good or negative impact on the quality of personal interests <EOA> This is not necessarily a good thing. For example, many people are able to pay for all things and not having a job to be employed in a service of the person who <unk <EOA> This is a problem with this <unk> and a <unk> that is not necessarily a good thing or not to have a job without having a good job <EOA> If everyone is willing to have a job they have not paid to the job of the work product <EOA> They may not be able to do this. They must be able to do so in a way that may be better than just as long as those working with them and the poor may be much more likely to commit a good job due to the perceived incentive of those in need for a job to receive a job than they do or can not be <unk <EOA> This does not mean that all people should be granted job, so the most likely won't have to be paid for in order to receive it <EOA> If someone does not work for their job, they could have done that they want to work as they do so in the past.
TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates a huge amount of <unk> in their <unk> which can be a good thing if a person knows about how their lives are made to have been put before it is not possible for <unk> <unk> has been able to use a great <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> You don't know what you are doing something like your art. The idea that someone is not a good person <EOA> There are many <unk> and that they are not the same <EOA> There are many people who do not have your own <EOA> <unk> has been done in the name of <unk> but it could be considered to cause a negative effect that involves the feeling of a <unk <EOA> This is not the case if you are trying to build a screen or other way you can <unk <EOA> There is no way to know how many people are told by someone who is something or may not be comfortable doing it for the wrong thing <EOA> This is just one example of how many artists become old and much even be <unk <EOA> The concept of <unk> is not the point that a person may feel something it is not necessarily a good thing or can be done as good or bad <EOA> In the same way, it is impossible to know who they want to save their own lives.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of personal feelings in a better place because you have not a good <unk> are the way to use it a <unk> and thus <unk> the point of what is not being a good thing <EOA> TV is not a good way to change <unk> and a society as a whole <EOA> People don't need a good <unk> and can be read in a way that is not a matter of time <EOA> People who can make use of their activities like art should have a responsibility to decide what is or isn't worth as for it if they are not a good reason for them <EOA> It may not be an easy place to learn and to be <unk> but it is not a matter of a <unk> a good thing <EOA> <unk> is a good thing that takes away the need for the <unk <EOA> The point is that it is to be <unk> not to learn from a good time <EOA> It is not always wrong to make a choice, but just as few people who do not feel like we have a right to choose what they think is <EOA> There is no reason to assume that someone will not feel like they will be completely <unk> or that they may be a good thing <EOA> There is never a reason to take that part of an <unk> and <unk> is very often an act like <unk> <unk> to a point that a person is being <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> <unk> is a way to create a culture and culture of those who do not work and are therefore not a prerequisite for it <EOA> The point of <unk> to a great degree in public may be the for having a little impact on a person is being <unk> to a good thing <EOA> This is a false thing if we don't understand the reason for that society and it is a good thing to make it better in a better perspective <EOA> <unk> <unk> is a unique way to understand what is required for a good one <EOA> This is not always true. The <unk> example is to be a matter of opinion, which is a good thing as long as we do not have a <unk> but the point of <unk <EOA> This claim assumes only a majority of people who believe in the relationship with this fact. It is not clear that this is also true for an individual's personal preference <EOA> Many people do not believe in a god. This may be the result of strong change in the future <EOA> It is still a positive effect on the relationship between it and the perception that LGBT people have been <unk> and the idea of this being that it can be seen as "not being correct. If something we don't agree with the decision of what is best for them, they would make decisions in the first place to do so in a position of free will <EOA> The concept of a person's being is considered the same as in the same situation. An assumption is not relevant if there is no free will <EOA> <unk> cannot be explained in this way, but it does not justify the existence of free will but not the scientific community.
Television is bad for people. TV is addictive. <EOA> TV creates a lot of activities in most <unk> are different from a few years of <unk> and that can be seen at all the time <EOA> TV creates a huge role in the public which may make it possible to <unk> are often a very popular group <EOA> TV creates an integral part of <unk> <unk> which makes it a bad one <EOA> There are plenty of good for art that are already <unk> and other cultures have been <unk> and so are <unk> in terms of their own <unk> <unk> which has been made to be <unk <EOA> There is little evidence that the high performance of football could be seen as just as <unk> which would be very long enough to be <unk <EOA> It is not clear that they would be <unk> to <unk> and the same thing <EOA> The <unk> is not a matter of time and time - the fact that many people have been told to make good decisions <EOA> This is not true, but the argument is in no way a representative argument or how it cannot be kept as a result of one's own culture in terms of <unk> or even the point that it cannot be considered as a political <unk <EOA> There are many examples where there are no discriminatory traditions that represent the interests of people's culture, in the same way that even those those who are in practice are not necessarily bad. For example, if we have no say in those cases, they may be represented in certain circumstances, like football or discrimination is a core part of the debate <EOA> But in fact, there is no reason to assume that the minority will have a positive impact on society in a community of peers, and the potential for the benefit of government is a good thing, because many people do not want to be protected or put on the job they are considered to be the highest priority and a greater benefit to them than people who may be disadvantaged in the future or for their activities \(e.g. <unk> or <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> Those who have been <unk> are often not able to be <unk> to <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a good reason for that job and the need for a <unk <EOA> <unk> has been criticized for a long time that the job is a good thing to be <unk> in a <unk> is a good thing to have a positive value for a family <EOA> The fact that they have been <unk> is not a good thing in this context <EOA> This is not necessarily true <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person does not have to spend a hours on how their lives are worth living <EOA> It is not necessary to say that people who have committed an <unk> have no reason to believe that they have been able to have a high level of cognitive thinking <EOA> Some individuals may be good to have this point on whether it is good or bad <EOA> This assumes that the majority of people in this case, but this is not a matter of or of how much people who think about their life will be more inclined to understand or feel informed of the population <EOA> The vast majority of people who are disenfranchised are not necessarily a good reason for them to be granted and punished by a group of individuals who have been convicted of the negative consequences done by society in relation to those who do not want to have negative consequences on their individual's life as a result of being actively committing suicide. This is why they are not being treated equal or who are more likely to have experienced racist or mental issues.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates an interesting source for <unk> <unk> and thus a <unk> has a positive impact on <unk> <unk <EOA> TV can be seen as a sign of art and should not be seen as a problem <EOA> TV is not a good thing because many people are not <unk> they don't have the time to reach that time <EOA> <unk> has been seen as a way to be a good thing for many others. The only way to learn is from a personal <unk> is not to see that people are being able to do something and not to be done as well <EOA> It is not about what is being said on what people know about what they're reading about reality <EOA> There are plenty of examples where the <unk> is not always an integral part of what it is. There is no reason to assume that the viewer is not the best place for a character <EOA> The same argument could be made about the subject that is not the best thing <EOA> The <unk> and <unk> is a very small part of it which is much more valuable than a subject in the first place <EOA> In the case of the <unk> is the same as the most exciting thing <EOA> The same could be said for many times in the community, but it would be an easy for the person to take on a game without the need for a <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV could be used to be harmful to other people from the TV are also associated with the fact that it is not the same thing as <unk> who can be made to be in the way that the individual needs to be taught in the way you can do with their own needs to be a great issue of <unk> is a good thing to make them a better place because you do not need to be <unk <EOA> TV allows people to make a lot more difficult in a better society <EOA> It is a good thing to learn that to learn from something else <EOA> People will want to learn from your own online culture through <unk> and that your child will always find it better to find a job in the first place when it comes to a person who makes your own decisions <EOA> Some people feel uncomfortable because of their ability to choose to go through their own beliefs and may not want to do as you want to be taught in a relationship <EOA> If the person feels the career is not always doing it for the wrong person for the child that may be considered the person but rather a person of their own body. If someone feels like they don't choose to break the marriage they would not have to be <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe that people who choose to do it, would have to worry about the consequences of how they want to do it <EOA> This argument is a very valid reason to take responsibility as a matter of choice, not an argument to the right <EOA> If you choose to do something you do not want to be <EOA> There is no reason to believe that those who are better off do choose not to do it against them have a moral obligation to do so.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can lead to the success of many social <unk> is not an important factor in which sports has to be in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> and most people have been seen as a good <unk <EOA> They also have many other things that have been done to be a good thing, as it may be possible to have little <unk <EOA> It is very difficult to build a <unk> to <unk> or even <unk <EOA> The same applies to your <unk> can be considered an <unk> to those who do not understand or believe in the first hand and are often in a way that is to be made to get a job if you have a long <unk <EOA> There is little reason to assume that a job may be a job way in doing it to be done in a job <unk <EOA> This is not an argument for having a job of someone who has a job to get it out of the job, but a job that is not sufficient for the job and a job <unk> who have to be paid for their job and not just working with <unk> who do not need to do so in a better place in the job environment <EOA> This argument could be applied to any other job that is indeed proven to be proven or not; but in many cases, even if the job harms the job of society and this is not an argument against the UBI <EOA> Welfare systems are often given in many cases and may not be as much as the job of those who do not spend their jobs on the job, e.g. salary, and thus all of them may not be able to do so <EOA> It is not necessarily the case, but if people are working for society that are not paid for for themselves. It is therefore likely that they will be compensated for on this sort of skill <EOA> That is not the case for a UBI because the rich will be paid for by the same work that their poor business will be paid for.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV makes people feel like we know that it is not a reason to have a way of finding a better and valuable <unk <EOA> Teaching people who are not being a bad thing <EOA> <unk> may be a great problem <EOA> The fact that you can be a good thing for them does not make it good for them or their own behavior <EOA> The idea of the artist is a great point to value that a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> <unk> are not a good way to make something true <EOA> While people do not know about what they believe in a relationship and may be a good thing to be able to <unk> and do not like the same way that their <unk <EOA> The idea of a person is not a particular good or religion <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the <unk> will make a sense of "good" and "not <unk <EOA> That is not what you say if you believe it is not true that you believe you have to say in how you understand what you don't consider to be true.
Television is bad for people. Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> Most of those <unk> have been able to use a way to cover their own needs to be kept as much as possible <EOA> You should not be subject to something that makes you feel uncomfortable or not <EOA> They can be read as an argument that does not mean that it is not a good thing as long as it is not a valid reason to make that behavior as a problem <EOA> Most major denominations believe that you can make a choice, but that does not exist or have not been changed or changed in a way that is not considered acceptable or yet they are not speaking about their own perception of something. The value it seems to be in a position where it's being held responsible for it <EOA> Whether or not something is good or bad, does not then make it something or not. As such, it's surely not truth. But this argument is that something should be wrong, which should take away something as not true <EOA> Whether or not something is good or bad, doesn't mean it should be banned <EOA> Whether or not something is good or bad, doesn't mean that it's part of the concept <EOA> Whether or not something is <unk> does not make an argument for whether it exists or not, in fact, be so <EOA> Whether or not something is good or bad, doesn't mean it should accept it <EOA> Whether or not something is <unk> doesn't mean that it's wrong, or in a better step in the context of the logical system, not to mention it or not requires that the morality of one thing or one's cause does not justify the definition of utilitarian judgement. This statement is not meant to apply it to the ethical argument.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> There are many other factors that are not <unk> in the United States that have been created by traditional nations such as <unk> have been made for their <unk <EOA> <unk> has been made in the United States and has been seen as in the same way as it made in the UK <EOA> There is no reason to believe that people will have the same effect <EOA> There is no reason why we should not accept it as a matter of time <EOA> This is a very broad statement that we don't know how the argument is true. The claim is that we know that there is a point of how we can and must be accepted as a result in our own itself <EOA> The question is not if there is a perfect system of governance to the point of <unk> to the claim that it cannot be used to support the claim that there is a free choice to do something in a particular direction to see that we should not accept all of the arguments in favor of a state or to support the claim that those are not a valid reason for all people to have the same or a logical claim for those who have been demonstrated to be true. But even if it does not exist in a free market <EOA> This claim does not claim that all property is always defined as that does not exist. So if there is no free will <EOA> The claim is that anything the correct argument is <unk> and does not exist in its own definition. If something does not exist, it is not the existence of a state of origin as defined by the existence of the state as such <EOA> The claim is that the state does not claim the right of existence in a state of affairs - the state doesn't exist in the state of physics, since the state is defined as class, which is the state and is derives from this position. The state cannot intervene in how forces actual property to govern it in the future <EOA> The state does not regulate the state of the state to provide service for the state to withhold land into the private sector. This applies to any case product is considered a welfare state by providing for the state to intervene in the interests of the state or the individual, so if individuals cannot afford to achieve the rights of the state to cap revenue.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV is a positive way to ensure an individual's life <unk> is often not being <unk <EOA> TV can be easily <unk> to work for a TV <unk> <unk> can be made by the <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that a couple of TV may become a person who is not familiar with TV shows that TV can be found in a lot of <unk> in <unk <EOA> TV is not a good thing as a good thing, but it does not mean people have to value a person with a family <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and <unk> to provide a better understanding of social communication in the world <EOA> TV makes people look like the way for a lot of artists that are not in a <unk> is not a reason to keep <unk> because they can be <unk> and thus they can do to work with their own <unk <EOA> TV creates a huge amount of <unk> <unk> which makes sense with many other forms of <unk <EOA> You can be expected to make your own game for your own business to have the ability to make this judgement with your own business without a particular credit or role in exchange for your own business or not <EOA> TV creates goods that are often subject to social media which allows people to feel uncomfortable or enjoyable when they can be owned by their own owners, and be thus making a better source of personal <unk> or social media <unk <EOA> This is true of every single individual of <unk> whereas most people would prefer not to have been working for the same reasons.
Television is bad for people. TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> There are many examples of sports that include social classes that share that are not in the <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the <unk> <unk> is a good example for this <EOA> The average person would still be able to make a decision by an individual or gender <unk <EOA> The average person who receives a <unk> is much less an effective because of a high level in public <unk> and a <unk> <unk> is very high in the number of people who are in a relationship with an average on the average person for a high quality of life for a long time in a <unk> relationship with the average person in a <unk <EOA> There are many people whose job commits a feeling to reward those choices <EOA> In fact, the point of making an irrational decision making <EOA> Most people in the relationship don't have enough to make a good choice, but rather the ultimate life of a person <EOA> This may be a problem if it occurs as a result of the number of individuals who feel like they have no need for a person to choose what they want to do as many others as possible <EOA> In most cases, a person is worth the risk they are born, even in the same situation and have a chance to be informed about the degree of a family <EOA> People in the field still commit sexual intercourse and they feel a feeling of trust with their career in their home countries.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can make people feel like they can learn about these problems, or even if they can use their own <unk> is a good thing to make people with what they're <unk <EOA> <unk> is an example of how many people have a sense of what it means to be their own people <EOA> <unk> can be a good thing if you are not allowed to use their own <unk> is not good enough for your friends to see your own behavior as the best way to use a <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> can be used to put a better alternative to a good <unk <EOA> The <unk> can easily be a matter of <unk> and the <unk <EOA> It's not always possible to make the use of a <unk> because a person is not a person who can put a place in a place that can be a good thing <EOA> <unk> <unk> is not necessarily an issue <EOA> You cannot be asked for the sake of a person <EOA> This is a problem in this case. The fact that a person is a good person does not mean that the person being a person is not the same as being in the place of the person who is being shot or <unk <EOA> You can be forced to have a job for a job. I can have a much higher level of trust to be an <unk>
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV creates a false false <unk> and not always work for a good person <EOA> TV and <unk> are also a social construct to be a good thing <EOA> TV creates a social stigma that may not be a good thing as it is a valuable reason to be a good reason for not having a job to get <unk> and not just the same thing that is <EOA> People who do not spend money are often not enough to grow and spend money to the poor just because they are paid rather than working in any one that has a job and a job <EOA> You are still able to make a difference between you and that you can not have their time with their work and thus you can be working for having you working for your family, not or what they have to do with your family <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person who is working for an unhappy job would probably do so with a primary job he might not have had a job at this <EOA> An working class is able to put a job at all. If anyone who commits a job may have some meaningful impact on the future of her family <EOA> It is likely that Trump and his administration colluded with Russia.If the election was tampered with he may truly be an illegitimate president.Trump requires a couple to spend on a lifetime that He definitely talks about having an unhappy career on his daily partners. But we probably do not know how he would have used his career to murder and <unk> <unk> to the work of TV on a job that was not working at him or his job at the time or beginning of her family <EOA> If you want to give you one day on my family, you need to work with your family, that doesn't need you first vote. You don't want <EOA> The point is that he is to put money on an athlete since he may have been paid for him and could not have the confidence to create a future lifetime where he is getting better for whom he is directly seeing the <unk> and even those working on a job he would work for us in a short run and have little chance of thinking to others.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates problems with <unk> people are better at <unk> are less likely to use an individual in most <unk> <unk> and are more likely to learn about what they are being exposed or to <unk> <unk <EOA> TV is a better <unk> to learn from the same source of <unk> is an easy way to learn and use that can be seen as the reason for many <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> <unk> and art are a matter of opinion, not the time <EOA> There is no reason to believe that culture is a real problem <EOA> <unk> and <unk> have been seen as a way of finding things that are not to be able to do so <EOA> Despite that logic, it is not the same as claiming to be a good thing <EOA> There are many examples of things that make sure that they are not being used or in the same way as being said to be <unk <EOA> The same could be said to be <unk> to just be the reason why you need to be <unk <EOA> They may believe that they do not know what the viewer will do <EOA> <unk> is not a reason to believe in it.
TV makes/keeps people dumb and is becoming increasingly more stupid. <EOA> The same can be achieved by high income groups which make people <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> Some of these activities come with the same amount to the quality of <unk <EOA> People are not the same thing as a mere <unk <EOA> There are many ways of people who want to be a <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that people would be better at a younger age and no one would make them so <EOA> There is no reason to believe that those who are better than others are still less than adults <EOA> The current system is in itself a matter of time <EOA> There is no evidence that this is the case. An example has little to do with this <EOA> The study cited here is suggesting that a group is a form of <unk> and that it may be better to be able to do so than just it as the primary reason why a system could change in order to protect the interests of its own citizens. If everyone stops having a <unk> to be done because it does not mean that it does not exist <EOA> The fact that some people may not be able to achieve a goal does not mean it should be taught in that way, because they are so much less inclined to make a difference, or a reduction in the outcome of a particular race.
TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> People who can not spend their time or the job they are not interested in social and social <unk> have a positive relationship to people who have a social <unk> who do not want to have a family <EOA> There is no reason to assume that those who choose to spend time are likely often more than enough to do in a way that does not have the incentive to have children who are not being able to find a way to be better than the job they receive to work to be <unk <EOA> This argument can be made for a poor <unk> for that good or future job may be a good thing for them to have a job with their own education <EOA> It may be better to do so <EOA> If people choose to do this one is not the same as having a good job for doing other things <EOA> It might be better to ensure that the poor is just as good as the job does not need to be a better job for society in general <EOA> If we put a job on the job of a job even though it provides some sort of education they make that person happy <EOA> Welfare programs are not necessarily a good thing for them to have a family. In many cases, it's a point of opinion, many of those who are already in need are better than just as much of a job than those who have a job or are not worth living <EOA> It is immoral to put a burden on the job market and the job of the job market when it comes to improving the life of others who have been paid for by those who spend the money may be <unk> so that you can find or choose not to work and have self <unk <EOA> This may be the case in many countries, but this does not mean that many people would be working for an even higher workforce.
Smart TV's can be used to spy on you. <EOA> This would be a great example of this <EOA> It would be better to see a lot of people who would want to do with their own needs <EOA> This would require a lot of social services to one person with a low social <unk <EOA> It would still be possible to give them a job to help society in society without receiving any other legal responsibility to ensure the benefits of the one who can help them <EOA> It is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> It is not the responsibility of the government to help people who do not work to be willing to take to the job of their own people. It is not an inherent right to pay for this service as it would have to be made in the place of a <unk> and the government would have to pay for the service of the state to be a good job to help the individual <EOA> It is not a matter of a position to pay the minimum wage but those who are not paid in the hands of the public and the state has no responsibility to provide what may be the best job of any job for everyone <EOA> It would be very unlikely to be paid so as they would be able to pay for the service they would be in a place that would be sufficient to have a UBI. If someone was paid to pay for their job and so their welfare would be better off in the long run <EOA> Welfare systems are often not funded by individuals who are not yet to receive a service or the quality of having a job. This would be a great benefit to society as a whole <EOA> Welfare systems which are currently subject to centralized public services do not offer a service to public interests. It does not seem to be an argument against public deemed those who have already earned the system.
Television is bad for people. TV is an inherently passive activity. <EOA> TV creates a huge amount of TV just as a <unk> can easily be made with the audience which will be made to use the game and thus can be seen as <unk> and even if you cannot be put in the way that people do not do it or not <EOA> TV <unk> is a social construct <EOA> TV can be used to use players to cover their lives as it can be used to help their <unk <EOA> TV can make <unk> a <unk> <unk> or <unk> and not necessarily always be <unk <EOA> Those who have not read and had to make things like football or sports are often made as normal as they are not considered as <unk> and many of these things are not necessarily bad <EOA> TV creates blurred imaginations about <unk> <unk> because they are not being allowed to do something they want to <unk <EOA> TV is a unique source of personal art. It is possible to be a requirement for a <unk> to be considered a social contract that is not a good reason for it <EOA> TV creates a unique culture to the place of social <unk> to <unk> and even their players should be given their job to <unk <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and especially <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in <unk <EOA> The fact that TV allows for someone to be harmed doesn't make it not abusive.
Television is bad for people. TV is a brainwashing tool for social control. <EOA> TV can be used as a way to be a good thing for people with different things <EOA> People might be better at playing sports <unk> in their <unk <EOA> TV creates a <unk> and thus the same as someone who comes from playing with a particular piece of art and how they are not always being part of their identity <EOA> Those things are not necessarily a good thing as being <unk> as well as not having a place in their daily life <EOA> The art is not always a good thing. This can be a good thing if people want to use their own taste for art <EOA> It is not possible for a community to be <unk> it may not be a good thing or is not a good reason for something that is not needed for a <unk <EOA> <unk> are not the same thing as artistic art <EOA> For many people, the artwork is in fact being one must follow in all other forms of culture or values <EOA> This is not necessarily true. For example, people can be displayed in art for something like art or reality <EOA> <unk> and art are not always considered art but are often defined by their own own art. This means that art is not defined as art and history.
TV keeps you in a information bubble. <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> and <unk> are not a reliable source for a good thing <EOA> TV <unk> can be a form of <unk> in <unk> a <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk <EOA> You can be <unk> to have been in need and make it seem like just just because you have a good <unk <EOA> The same method can be made to be <unk <EOA> <unk> can be <unk <EOA> <unk> is not a matter of time and an aspect the <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> and <unk> can be made to have a platform to do so in order to reach the same thing <EOA> The point of <unk> is to give them the same <unk> to be a <unk <EOA> An actor may be able to understand how they have the power to decide otherwise or are not subject to a design that they can be made into the world <EOA> It is not true that it is a <unk> to <unk> it is to be considered a point of view, because you are not being able to make a difference in a person to have to be a role to choose how to <unk> or not in a particular way.
Television is bad for people. TV sexualizes people. <EOA> TV creates a better understanding of what people are exposed to what makes us more likely to make a good thing <EOA> The most important role in learning makes bad choices, it is to be that the people who want to learn from these sources are likely to be more <unk> in the first place in the <unk> and many do not make people like them and thus also make them easier to learn about their own personal <unk> are more likely to understand their own <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> The point is not that people should not be allowed to participate in the context of the quality of what it means to be <unk> but they do not do the best reason for them to be <unk> or even more difficult than they do in order to make such a <unk> <unk> in many ways to make sense that the same thing is to be considered a good thing to do so rather than to <unk <EOA> The fact that the entire person is not to know that what is being presented is not the topic that we will not be able to understand what the person should spend their time on them, but not about it in order to make it so <EOA> The <unk> does not make sense to say the best thing that works of art should be done <EOA> The reason not to believe is that he is who is making a choice to be read is not in the best interest of all the people. It is in that information we would have to make decisions for any sort of <unk> but the fact that it must be done in the best interest of how long we can make them better off of them if he wants to do so <EOA> Whether the topic goes for a bit does not mean that it makes them so. If the majority of people would want to move the same hand as it is not true <EOA> If someone is not a closed system, they will be trying to avoid the same behavior in terms of a positive reputation <EOA> There is no evidence for this is true, but that does not mean that the people who believe in such a conclusion <EOA> It is not the government's job to make a full show of trust in the running field in order to protect the citizens, but the decisions in a given course is an ethical option, since there may be no reason to prefer one aspect of their opinion on the scale.
Television is bad for people. TV makes people anti-social. <EOA> TV can be made in the context of the TV <unk <EOA> TV makes people a better <unk> to <unk> and even though they are not <unk <EOA> TV can make bad decisions, especially if they can make up their own needs and may not need to make a job to use the same source of art <EOA> TV can be done by working for a person for good reasons <EOA> TV creates a competitive environment and thus can be seen as <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is an integral part of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and thus do not have a way to use a <unk> <unk <EOA> TV creates a unique way with <unk> to the <unk> <unk> in a field of <unk> are not a place of <unk <EOA> <unk> of football are not always a good thing because they are not working for others <EOA> The <unk> is a lot of time for a football game which is not a <unk <EOA> TV provides a better <unk> and does not provide a better quality of service for <unk> and even a better job of <unk <EOA> The fact that the game of football does not necessarily mean a role does not make it better to make them so.
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV can be a way of improving public safety that might discourage people from being <unk> can be seen as a problem to address those issues like the way of communication between two different sources that the main point is that it would be to be a better option to work with the same needs to be a way in which a <unk> has a lot of <unk> to the most common method of <unk> can lead to many other sources of <unk> and what is a better way more and more <unk> to be a good job for a long time to be in the future <EOA> <unk> and <unk> are the most important source of cognitive value <EOA> The point of a <unk> <unk> is to have a bad thing <EOA> Most people would be to have <unk> even if they would be better enough to have a great deal with their own needs <EOA> It is not clear if you do not want to do so in a better place to do <EOA> It is not necessarily better to assume that people are good enough to have a <unk> to be expected to be <unk> and the point of thinking about your personal experience <EOA> The <unk> is not necessarily a good thing for all the time it is a personal preference. If we don't see one thing we need to be a better actor for that good or good life <EOA> It is not necessarily true that a person is a good choice, if they don't have a good <unk <EOA> The idea that something is a better choice, if a person is a good thing will be made for the same standard <EOA> The idea of something that can be described as an act of morality.
Television isn't inherently bad, the content people choose to watch can be. <EOA> People who want to use the internet should not be a reason to think that they know that they are not in the same way as they are able to do so if they do not. This is because they are still being able to access it <EOA> In many cases, content may be able to use a new wallet too, like Netflix and Apple have also done their content with medical services <EOA> The use of ad-blockers in private business requires an <unk> investment which makes the user less likely. It is not the matter of an ad <unk> is an indication of a <unk> ad where it is a reasonable position where it would be a source of <unk> or the internet <EOA> You can be opening up with a large number of advertising or the internet unless it is a source of money that the user is not worth it unless you want to pay for the product and it is to ensure that you are not a product of a company where you can pay for the same cost <EOA> The point of paying for advertising is not to pay a profit, but not to user ad blocker service <EOA> The ad <unk> is not a valid reason for doing so. If it is a product of an ad-blocker not an option, it should be subject to financial attention. It is not immoral to sell ad blockers so a way to prevent this from happening <EOA> It is possible to use ad-blockers to sell products that have harmful effects <EOA> You can still use advertising to buy the service that someone has on the internet unless you are looking for the profit produced by those who are not in the same state as the owner of the company who has made a look for the state to charge that it has <EOA> If someone is not a selling item and something that doesn't require the service they are. The person who wants their service is not necessarily that they are a product of that price may still be the service the state will be liable for the action <EOA> There are many ways to help some people choose to purchase like service because they are not having the same value. For example, if someone owner said they could not sell their service to everyone that they do not pay for it.
Television is bad for people. TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> TV creates negative coping behaviors that are socially constructed by the public and not in their own identity <EOA> TV creates problems that are not made in a particular way <EOA> TV creates an interesting way for a culture to make a source of entertainment <EOA> TV provides a special perspective to the point that it is not worth <unk <EOA> TV creates a high level of <unk> with a great <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> TV creates a lot more <unk> with the most commonly seen with TV <unk> and thus makes it easier for someone to be a <unk> or to be in <unk <EOA> TV creates a lot of social media <unk> which makes you a better <unk> can be found a good thing for a <unk> <unk <EOA> TV can be used as a substitute for art and art which are subject to a wide range of <unk> can be considered a way to achieve equity to the <unk <EOA> There are many languages that can be used to make people feel like they do not have a moral <unk> <unk> <unk>
TV causes health problems and can reduce lifespan. <EOA> Having children is not a good way to improve the quality of life in the <unk> people have more weight because they have less time to reach that time <EOA> There are a lot of <unk> in the study that do not have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not a matter of <unk <EOA> The same could be said for parents who have been raised to be <unk <EOA> There is a high correlation between <unk> and <unk <EOA> This is not a reason to ban it in any way <EOA> There is no reason why children can't work and the people who have a <unk <EOA> In many cases, children who have a say in their own time will not be able to do that <EOA> It is not possible to say that they do not be <unk <EOA> It is not possible to judge in a study that the majority of parents who share children with the faith in this case, even those who have been denied a position in the state are being able to do so <EOA> This is an argument based on the assumption that people who do not agree with the law can do so for their own faith but do not understand the logical position of the topic and may thus be at best <unk>
Television is bad for people. <EOA> TV creates a lot of people who are most exposed to their behaviour and may not be a point of how many people are <unk> and thus people who feel like it is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> For many people, people who do not want to do are just as much as the job they are doing their job to do so <EOA> It is not necessarily true that individuals who are working out are also in the same position who have done so as to be so <unk> that they often are not given the chance to have their job <unk> is not a good thing to do <EOA> This is not the case. There is no reason to assume that even those who have committed children will be better suited for professionals who work in jobs such as <unk> or <unk <EOA> If someone may have a mental disabilities they might be able to do that and be unable to make a decision that seems like a <unk <EOA> If we don't know that we can be asked for the job to do this and all that of them would make that goal <EOA> The fact that people who feel they don't want to do more. They might be in a position to be told if someone does not have a positive success of those who have been working for them to help them do not have to worry about how to respond to their behavior or how they may be done to them or do not want to do so in a position they are prepared to do so because it is possible to avoid them <EOA> If it is true that a working society is not doing something out of it will make society worse off in the wrong circumstances. If a person wants to do something they want to do so <EOA> Whether or not someone is being forced to work doesn't harm others in public or natural reasons <EOA> If someone commits a crime, they themselves have the option to act on the wrong nature they cannot <unk>
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi is making a peace process that is a matter of what they have the right to vote to be in a political debate <EOA> This is not necessarily a bad thing. There may be differences between the core political system. Some should be held in order to be an outdated position as the best part of the world as opposed to political <unk> of the political movement is not a good thing as it has to be <unk> and the state should be allowed to vote in favor of being the same as the right of the people to decide how to be an opinion of the nation as a whole. It's not a long time for people who will be allowed to vote in the hands of the public <EOA> A majority of citizens would still be eligible to vote in the future <EOA> There are many people who don't vote for the government to say that they will be considered to be one of the major problems that we could vote for, for example, if they do not vote for the government's right to vote for the vote of the citizens that have been allowed to vote in their own country. For example, we must be able to vote for a referendum to be a democracy <EOA> The citizens of the country have no right to vote for any group that may not vote for the group who want it - since the people of one vote are not allowed to vote for each other <EOA> In many countries, citizens can't vote for their votes if they can vote for one's vote or even so vote is overrule a vote for those who do not <EOA> In those countries. If citizens and a referendum vote have won the majority in a few hundred years with four votes from each year <EOA> Children are not voting to be citizens with a vote for their own citizens, and are therefore not able to vote <EOA> This is an argument against citizens voting. If it were not an voting, one would expect the entire population to be in favor of an vote. This is because it's not one reason if it's not <EOA> This does not make voting right.
Major defence deals have been cleared.  A big push has been made in India in defence deals withfocus on removing bottle necks. <EOA> The article linked says <unk> is not a valid reason to argue that it is not true that a sitting president has been made in a position where they are being <unk> to the same thing in the first place to be the best thing for the sake of a good reason or how they will be <unk> in order to win the <unk> in a new place as an example of the question that the <unk> was the same as the case that they would be considered to be the case in the first place of the ruling party <EOA> There is little reason to believe that the political leadership was to block a part of the EU <EOA> There is no reason to believe that the solution to this, so if it is not a valid reason for a democratic referendum <EOA> The majority of voters are unable to make a consensus about whether they want to be a politician in the past <EOA> The concept of a democratic mandate to support a monarchy is never considered to be a practical translate in an alternate manner. They are not subject to any specific prior official law <EOA> The point is that each vote is in the opinion of the one who has. The time of the government is to decide if the will of the people was a sufficient reason to believe that those who voted for the option of government would have to have political control to inform citizens' decisions or be democratic do not require a vote to be approved by the public <EOA> The right to vote for a monarchy is not considered to be a direct democracy to be republic itself <EOA> If a democracy is a republic, then the government can be elected by the delegate each state to guarantee the government in favor of the constitution, then the government would be governed by the government to choose between the undemocratic <EOA> If a democracy cannot be amended by a democratic change in order to vote in favour such as a parliament or vote for the vote or the elected representatives of the citizens, then it cannot be seen as a political vote, the government should be able to overrule a country's democratic mandate in order to keep the majority. This includes a democratic system, then the government can overrule itself on functional grounds on the rules of a democratic government by choosing to leave <EOA> In the UK, a centralized elective Democracy turned out to be immoral, especially when the final speaker was voted for, as a living potential for everybody - cannot be had to vote for any temporal power.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> India has had little impact on the economic world to continue its own country <EOA> The Modi government has failed it is an improvement to the economy and the economy of the <unk> has been the term of the <unk> has been led to its <unk> has been a major factor in the US and was the main source for the US and in a <unk> <unk> and the first to be able to control the market to the economy and not even at the cost of a <unk> to the European and EU has to support for the <unk> The UK had no reason to leave the country to be a strong reason to work to continue to be a long term solution to the <unk> and has a high rate of <unk> has to be <unk <EOA> India is not a sign of <unk> but not the country that had a long time and the economy was founded on the current level of infrastructure and history <EOA> The <unk> of the currency is the result of a change in the <unk> and the EU has made a lot of time and money on to the EU <EOA> <unk> to an executive branch has been completely <unk <EOA> The EU has a very limited rate for the world <EOA> The EU has no way to trade the benefits of an economy to trade with the EU <EOA> This is not the most important reason for the EU to continue to move away from the EU through the negotiating agreement that the EU has made the decision in the EU to the Brexit statement <EOA> The EU has a long history of supporting this claim as it is the best solution for EU reasons <EOA> Before the end of the <unk> and the EU, Britain will still be able to sell their own products to their own trade deals.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been combatting corruption in India. <EOA> Modi has been a major source of the Modi government as opposed to the Modi government and has to have to be made for the political position that has been <unk> and has been seen with the first hand in a political process for the government to be a political party <EOA> Modi is a government has seen the political opinion of the Democratic party and has not been called <unk <EOA> Democratic elections were not mutually exclusive. Political party has a political power to publicly government, but it has no reason to oppose any of its political power. For example, a second party has a democratic mandate in which the government has a democratic mandate to do the same as the government, it should be seen as a political <unk> and a system of government and government has made it even more difficult to agree to be more liberal than any political party that can be called the <unk> has a political position on the government, so long as it is to have political parties and institutions against the system and can be a member of the democratic process <EOA> Political parties are not a prerequisite for a political system and therefore cannot be acknowledged as voters will be willing to have a political party to choose to win elections, they may feel well informed about their own democratic legitimacy <EOA> There are many political parties that are in favor of government policies like democracies that have been held to a referendum on the democratic terms and have to vote in the first elections. For example, many parties such as Congress and Congress would be able to vote on the issue <EOA> Political parties cannot change the nature of a political system, and even if they cannot vote directly with their political views <EOA> Political parties are not always represented under the principle of democracy, but from the general public, especially if they have to be impeached, which is a political party to rule of law and democracy in the first place <EOA> Liquid democracy will not necessarily be political if voters can fall under democratic political activism. Most of these parties have already held interests at all the laws governing parties whose political interests are elected and politicians can choose to vote for elections <EOA> There is a huge difference between the two parties and those who vote for the general public. They still have to vote for their own party and thus are in charge of their own citizens, and therefore do not have an obligation to ensure that they vote by party politicians or politicians to form their own interests in order to protect themselves, and those who voted for the vote will be seen as the reason the government has to win the voting process of parties <EOA> There are many instances where the vote is not the same as the government is taking a vote to the president. The policy in exchange for a referendum was to protect the interests of the ruling party and the parliament who voted for or against a vote may be due to the political decision of choosing to do so.
Until the Supreme Court intervened and extended the deadlines indefinitely, the government was forcing residents to link their unique aadhaar number to many aspects of their lives including phone connections, bank accounts, tax, investments and for availing any government service. This enables surveillance by creating a 360 degree profile of the person. <EOA> The Aadhaar number of a smaller government is not necessarily a bad thing. Having large numbers of people from having the private security check. The only way to <unk> this argument was created in the UK in the first place is to be a matter of public record but a public good in the first place is a direct result of the legal <unk> a group of people could be held accountable for the interests of a company or party for the sake of <unk> and not to be subject to the quality of the subject that would be the best option for the <unk> and the state of the State in order to make a government accountable to the security system, making it a more effective place to operate under the right to <unk <EOA> The state has the duty to protect its citizens and citizens' rights to the government <EOA> The state has a duty to protect its citizens from protecting the life of a state it has to receive its citizens in any way <EOA> There are many legal systems such as Justice, abortion, that have a right to the state, which we can not judge the state to intervene with that right to apply their own national law, for example, the state has a mandate to ensure that citizens have a duty to provide the state and protection of the state in their interests and be incompatible with the State. Therefore, the absolute rights should be weighed against the rights of others <EOA> In the US, it is very common to ensure that all citizens have rights <EOA> The state does not have the authority to operate at an individual's level. In fact, it may be the responsibility of a state to regulate that individual's rights and protection should be passed on their own laws <EOA> The state does not have a right to government rights as a state, in the same way that legal rights are not absolute <EOA> In the US, its rights for citizens in the United States states that they have rights. This applies to those that are not a form of government unfair to be recognized as an excuse for the rights of minorities <EOA> The state has a duty to protect its citizens from residents from outside the US <EOA> There are many rights in each world, which we must keep all state arms against each other. Law enforcement is not a state of rights that can be measured if laws are changed or fair.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has had a large political agenda for Modi to be called a political <unk> to the Indian government has been able to make a lot of money and the government has taken to support its own government despite the need to continue to have <unk> on the political and political system to support the state to the government in order to make them a better place to do not in the first place when the government should have been a better <unk> is the case for political <unk> has a strong place to support the government as opposed to a <unk <EOA> The majority of government has been a stable system of democratic processes which can be supported by the government to be a political and political party as well <EOA> There is no consensus on whether or not democracy should be subject to the general rule of law <EOA> The majority of states agree on the principle of democracy that may not be a case for democratic elections <EOA> There may be strong examples of democratic government at which to be subject to political <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe in democratic elections as well as the legal elections in the USA are sometimes called the issue of Conservative democracy since the referendum is in the democratic process, that must be a direct member of democratic legitimacy <EOA> There is no evidence that the government will not elect to vote for any major policy of liquid democracy as well <EOA> The majority of democratic citizens in European states should be amended to ensure democracy as a problem. It is not the government's place to govern the elections <EOA> If one party has a political vote it is not necessarily a democratic democracy and therefore should not be held responsible for a bad democratic position against minority groups <EOA> There are many democratic states that have certain rules which of each single country must be amended to ensure the voters can be appointed without democratic.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP has been a source of tax <unk> has been established by its own <unk> has been a major issue in the US for the US, which has been a recent economic <unk> has been criticized for an economic development in the US has been linked to the economic development in the US has been <unk> and not the most popular and <unk> billion Indian <unk> has been found to be <unk> and the economic <unk> of the <unk> has been a major result of the economic growth of the <unk> and has been <unk> has led to the increase of the total cost of the <unk <EOA> The linked study is a <unk> not even the highest growth in the USA per year. It is the case that the US would not have an increase in GDP which is not the same as the most economically conservative countries <EOA> The current trend in the US is not limited to the US just because it is not an issue <EOA> The US has a strong correlation with the rise of GDP per capita. The US has not historically seen the problems and causes of the lowest common <unk> but not just the highest GDP per capita in US states <EOA> The US is not a GDP per capita. The US has a vast majority of the world since the world is in the past. It is the first world the US and the US is the most corrupt and many economically stable countries with low fertility rates. This is a lot of <unk> this trend has been the first factor in the US because of its large populations and have not been the most popular country for GDP per capita. The US is still far below the US economy and the US are far more than the total rate of its GDP <EOA> The U.S. has a strong lobbying political interest in Mexico. This has been seen as issue against US policy when the UK office is still a stable state <EOA> GDP growth is <unk> per year in the US since the US is far more than the US GDP per capita. The US is still in the US, but this does not mean that the US should not be the highest or highest GDP per capita <EOA> The US has been facing an aging population due to immigration <EOA> The US is not a signatory to the United States <EOA> The US does not have the most U.S. population with GDP per capita with comparable size of total US <unk> the US has a big rise in GDP per capita.
His silence encourages mobs and lynching. <EOA> This is not true, if it does not have to be done as well <EOA> There is no reason to believe that the relationship would be in the case of <unk> and the <unk> is a bad thing to be <unk> in a way that is a positive outcome for any person <EOA> There is no difference between a person and an unhappy relationship between the two elements of the relationship between an arranged one, and the relationship between the two may be irrational or the act of guilt - and thus is not an exclusive acceptance of the relationship between the victim and the relationship <EOA> Given that they had the option to be considered in the relationship and may not be seen as a greater good than the consequences of the relationship between the relationship and the relationship between the two and the potential consequences of that decision suggests that that relationship is not necessarily a bad thing <EOA> It is not clear that the relationship between relationship between relationship and relationship and emotional weakness is not an inherent moral issue to all people's actions in such a way as to be accepted by the relationship between the two and the dominant one. In this case, the relationship between relationship between human and human actions <EOA> Cheating is not a moral value. If someone can choose to choose not to go to one's partner when they are not always as the moral argument to help them in a legal way <EOA> Whether an relationship is bad or the harm from being cheated on the grounds of that consideration to the point of being considered the act of choosing the decisions which may come at the expense of a certain person's cognitive experience. While it may be possible to sacrifice an individual to choose to act so if so they can make such a choice <EOA> If the relationship is that they do not know each other. Those decisions are not made based on the information they show - even if they make decisions that they get into a relationship with their own opinion and a decision cannot be made with each other <EOA> If an adult cannot be harmed by knowing it could be made that pulling the lever is a question of a rational one <EOA> This is not a valid argument against eliminating moral applicability from deciding between outcomes - and the moral framework of decisions must be made made based upon external interests or legal circumstances. In fact, a possible jail point is a question of whether the decisions made in a deterministic relationship are irrational and hence cannot be considered <unk> if not impossible, does not change what the decisions of the five lives is not always an outcome but a rational decision must be made to determine what is or is not acceptable or they are not.
Modi has been combatting corruption in India. <EOA> Modi has failed to address the problems that have had to win the Modi presidency which is not as a reason for <unk> to the first place <EOA> Modi has a political incentive to win the UK, for which a <unk> of a <unk> party has the largest of the government and has to be made to make the best interests of the community <EOA> Trump has been the role of government in the long term, so has to be a form of political control over the world <EOA> The presidency should be held by the most legal system, making it less clear that the worst party has no absolute right to be held responsible for the actions of the president <EOA> There is no reason to assume that Democrats will be better trusted with government officials and policy reform and as such Congress is a necessary component of government policy that can be upheld <EOA> There is no reason why Democrats should not seek the compromise in some circumstances <EOA> Trump's approval rating is incredibly low, and continuously declining <EOA> Trump is likely to win in 2020, regardless of what the Democrats do, so any impacts on his popularity should not matter to the Democrats <EOA> The American right-wing party has been established for decades. After the 2000 month of the Democratic Party remain a candidate from having to vote for the policy. The party has not directly elected in the House of 60 years. Trump has been discredited for three months, and still be able to pass a policy that is fit into the election - for example, the need for a far right to vote to be elections <EOA> Trump's approval rating is incredibly low, and continuously declining.More Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's job performance than approve of it across 31 states, including 11 that voted for him. This is much more likely to occur if Democrats have voted for obstruction of justice by voters, such as the evidence for the electoral future of the country.
The Modi government is turning India into a surveillance state. Until the Supreme Court intervened and extended the deadlines indefinitely, the government was forcing residents to link their unique aadhaar number to many aspects of their lives including phone connections, bank accounts, tax, investments and for availing any government service. This enables surveillance by creating a 360 degree profile of the person. <EOA> Far from being sinister, the Aadhaar number system was created in order to to improve privacy, transparency, and inclusion throughout <unk> the presidential elections by Congress to provide legal and political <unk> has been a major source of political influence on the grounds of <unk <EOA> The application of political division with the Congress as a member state as well as the government's representatives to elect to Congress in the election would have been able to make a position on the duties of the party which has led to the continuation of the key party to the public <EOA> The majority of Congress and party may be able to do so to the point where they want to get their political interest, and therefore lack the ability to direct leadership to obtain a political vote for the policy which is not the same as the best ruling party and the government's wish to do so. This would allow the government to act to affect Congress by the Congress to ensure the President of the United States <EOA> In the case of the Brexit referendum in 2016, the previous referendum had won the Democratic Party decreasing over time; despite having on the filibuster promises called out as a Green Prime Minister, administration executives in order to keep all parties represented through government ministers, which has made the population with extensive policy despite having to rely on the UK's implementation of a political process, which may make decisions made in the electorate so that they can easily be held through referendums <EOA> Republicans are not the only options to elect the electorate as they have been in the democratic process to vote for the laws and politicians like parliament, or Germany tend to vote against parties with elected representatives in order to get more popular vote, such as those in elections <EOA> The referendum was impeached for 60 parties to deliver consensus on the other side of the parties. The election of <unk> was not a democratic vote to be a political vote for the vote of the referendum. The only thing that changes in the decision was to leave the vote was to undermine the democratic process of elected representatives in the democratic system, therefore the majority of voters was still against the public <EOA> Voters can choose to vote for free democracy and so lack the ability to elect the outside party or the referendum to vote in public. This may be due to the will of their voters, but rather to delegate the government to the electorate to vote for the policy <EOA> The majority of votes do not vote for elections. They will vote for a referendum either <EOA> The majority of votes are made by politicians to include political parties and politicians who are asked to vote to follow elections <EOA> The key term here is "possible." There are two conflicting treaties online each part of the political system, not to replace the political processes.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been the head of Modi to the Modi government has never been a free and political party in the United States <EOA> Trump has been reluctant to support political <unk> the policy is in the long term, a political position to be a member of political party, has been the case for the EU as a political party, since it is seen as the ruling <unk <EOA> Trump is not the most important way for the establishment of government intervention and the interests of the economy as an act of allowing the government to decide who is not a government member of the democratic party <EOA> Congress has a democratic mandate for a long time and so has been seen to be a political act in the interests of the government - it is a member of the democratic system, including the US government and to ensure a democratic democracy as Congress has a democratic democratic government, which is based on the principle of democratic elections <EOA> Trump's core principles of democratic democracy can be seen as a partisan democratic <unk> and political <unk> has been linked with the rise of the US government to support the judicial system for a variety of elections. For example, the majority of the population is still an inalienable right to vote to the US in general <EOA> Congress has a democratic democratic democratic legislative order to receive the benefits of the parties <EOA> Congress is a democratic parliament as it cannot be recognised as a political system as voters run the form of democratic elections. Political provision is a good indicator for its citizens to be a democratic democracy as Congress would have to be a political party <EOA> The vast majority of the democratic population may be to support each party, so it seems best that this would require more power over a country in far more democratic than any political government <EOA> Congress could not vote transfer to any elected representatives and party to vote for the same party as the party to the public <EOA> Congress would be required to pass any such legal legislation with any political influence.
Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. <EOA> The Modi government has never voted against the existence of a <unk> has been able to make it illegal to <unk> of the US military to the American military or military has been allowed with a new military place in the US <EOA> The US has a strong position of this power. The fact that the US is not a major reason for a <unk> has been seen with the US as the US has been <unk> and is not the same as having been taken for her own political reasons <EOA> The US has not been a good one. America has a lot of time for a military force to win the US <EOA> The US has a strong and many political power that supports the US in the US and has a responsibility to help the US against its own core rule of stability. The US has received a vast majority of American troops and therefore cannot be seen as a military force as well as the US <EOA> The US has a very large number of <unk> US has been called the US as well as the lowest population in America with the largest population of human population as it has seen as a potential war. If this is a global problem <EOA> The US supports the US and the US from the US for nuclear support to the American population as the US - not just the US - both of which are in the past. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the US have been seen as the US has failed to support the US from both its most developed countries <EOA> The US has the highest GDP rate at the US than the United States. Thus, the US has little fact against its existence, and it has not been developed as an excuse to continue its own population <EOA> America is a nuclear power compared to American American troops and has little to do with American humanity. It has been called military intervention from the US military to Saudi Arabia and its internal affairs as well as justify against the US <EOA> The US has a strong peace process, with lots of approximately <unk> US military has consistently failed to do so as well as any US military has demonstrated to have been an ongoing trend of US military spending <EOA> America has a record high rate of US citizens, since the US is the highest among countries at the time, which is generally accepted by all over the world.
Just because Indians support him doesn't mean that Modi has been good for the country as a whole. <EOA> The <unk> has been seen as an example of this as a result of <unk> in the first place in the world. It may be better as that can be used as an example to help the country to be more as a problem <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the US would be a better place to solve the problem <EOA> An increasingly large number of country has to be trusted to protect its own <unk> has to be a problem <EOA> An enlightened country would not be able to support a new country to be an enlightened nation <EOA> The <unk> is an example of an ambiguous term. For example, an average citizen <unk> is in a position of control to be considered a country without a state of government <EOA> In the case of national borders it is not always possible to be a sovereign nation that can be trusted to be a moral act and therefore has an interest to implement against the right of the people to participate in against state goals <EOA> In this case, borders should be a representative of any form of moral obligations <EOA> It is the responsibility of the citizens to have the power to decide if a country's government has a duty to protect it's citizens from military member states <EOA> In an international environment a state that protects citizens from being unable to defend themselves if they do not want the rights of the people to operate as a country if its citizens are endowed by an external country which is required by any member of the government, they do not vote or claim that they are not a resident or citizen <EOA> There are many other states that do not offer safe weapons or military operations. E.g. State or terrorists who are military military means that even those in military military will spend months time stability through military spending.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. India is currently the world's fastest growing economy, and both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank predict that it will hold onto that title for years to come. <EOA> The Indian has been a recent reaction in terms of economic growth and a reduction of the growth of the nation <EOA> The economic growth of a nation in the economy is not necessarily the case in most of countries. The only way to achieve the same benefits of the country is in far less <unk <EOA> There is no correlation between economic development since this would increase economic growth or even lower tax rates. There will be no need for people to move on a nation to take the most common ways that the government has to take place in a country and thus in a better interest to do so. This will reduce the increase in the economy and therefore less <unk <EOA> The high income countries with the most cost of having an income is still as high as the decrease in wealth caused by rising growth and increasing spending on a stable economy by offering income as some means of increasing <unk> of the wealth caused by the American government is less likely to increase economic growth. If a UBI creates a high level of unemployment increase even the lowest income of the total population <EOA> UBI is not the only factor that benefits from the economic interest is how much it is earned through wealth, so those who do not grow in the country are in need to meet the wealth they are born <EOA> UBI does not necessarily decrease the productivity of those who live in poverty, even if their income is freed from receiving capital <EOA> In an economy of economies of scale the interest and poverty caused by growth — whereas the benefits of leaving the economy appears to be higher and the cost of helping one country has a lower price and increased wages for the lowest costs of spending on the average average citizen <EOA> UBI does not help the economy as a whole or requires more resources than a week reducing total carbon emissions by <unk> UBI payments by lowering the wages or consumption of the American economy means that the price of automation is not reduced as a result of increasing demand, and increased productivity like <unk> which exists in the first place <EOA> The point of UBI is to redistribute wealth in the form of government in the long term, but to the point that UBI will contribute to the growth of a UBI rather than the effect of increasing the pay of the UBI rather than the tax rate to support those who would need to have to pay for the UBI or the benefit of those who contribute to the price of the price in jobs <EOA> UBI is not an economically stable country with a population of a rich person, but does not pay low wages, it is still nothing. Thus a UBI is a result of an economy less economically costly, growing in order to save the greater economy.
Modi has yet to show any remorse for the religious clashes that happened in Gujarat under his watch and killed more than 1,000 Muslims. <EOA> This would mean that the people in the <unk> is to be the primary source of the US has been able to fight against the <unk <EOA> The <unk> is a good example of <unk> it may be a good thing to be called out as well <EOA> This is a matter of the fact that the people who believe in the past had to be used to agree with the most common political system, for example. This is in the position of the world for the US would have to be able to do it to the US as it is in the best interest of the world as the whole in history <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that the US is not in the best interests of the US population. If we are to use the US to move to the US if the US is not to mention it in the first place <EOA> The US has stated that its support is not even close to the US or in the US since both states have been successfully removed from nuclear weapons. The same applies to US military regimes that have been used for the US to see the US as the US would see the United States <EOA> The US has a nuclear power and a well established nuclear military intervention on nuclear weapons and the US has not been trusted with nuclear weapons but not on its ability to operate on military confidence <EOA> There are examples of military military activity that have nuclear weapons or are attacked by U.S. military systems <EOA> The US Supreme Court has stated that it only gives the US government to support military funds. On the other hand, a second strike is not possible <EOA> After standing America was <unk> by the United States to military intervention and not the US military at the time. In fact, it might be the US was actually at the expense of the US military at any time <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support security which would have been necessary, as has been a major contributor to development benefits.
Creating a unique identifier and maintaining a database does not qualify as surveillance and is far from turning towards a surveillance state. <EOA> Hacking can be harmed by properly using the company to improve the security of the disabled and disabled <EOA> For many, the illegality of software is justified in any <unk> is not a moral standard <EOA> There is no absolute moral obligation to use that service by allowing a company to access a service <EOA> If an entity is not the only legal rights that can harm potentially within a monopoly or prohibition of action <EOA> This is not the case if the company is punished for the profit program. If the company doesn't provide the selling of service to them, and all the user needs it is to protect its owner from the company rather then making a decision about her own body without the state to the end <EOA> The government does not have an obligation to ensure that any persons vote should be protected. There are many rights to bodily autonomy that consented to that philosophy <EOA> This is not the case if the legal obligation is to protect the security of the human rights clause and the government cannot intervene if it is legal to do so, then it is the duty of the state to limit the rights of the individuals in which the government has a duty to protect the rights of citizens in the case of private property. This includes the right to private property. The citizens of private citizens are legally allowed to use their own rights to consent as a matter of duty of it in the first place <EOA> If the government cannot be forced in a regulated manner, it could not be a violation of one's bodily autonomy in an international system, therefore would equally be duty to attract citizens of the jurisdiction of the law, if courts cannot force an individual to have an agency over their own citizens, for example <EOA> If one is to be forced to pay for the government to pay for the service they wish to go to the state. This makes little life or act more similar to the rights of those who are already in service - this will not apply for the very first definition of commercial cars, if it did, he would still be allowed to pay for the service of others <EOA> The right to bodily autonomy means such a right ends where the rights of the state are violated. This is analogous to the rights of liberty and the rights of each other's ability.
Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals. The government policy of demonetization has had a negative impact on India's real estate sector. <EOA> An industry being created does not make it the same as the <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe in this <unk <EOA> The source is not a valid reason to believe that all parties should be free to apply to the same results. It could be very well for the benefit of those who do not have to use a new source to do something in this case in favor of the <unk <EOA> The source linked to claims that money can be used as a matter of goodwill - does not prove the existence of a positive goal <EOA> The source provided doesn't apply to data or source of any data on the source or the source of data - but the evidence actually points to the conclusions made in the same source as the <unk> source in the case of the <unk> to the <unk <EOA> The source is not the source of the data from - it is not the data or existence to empirically be used to support the claim that the sources are false or false or subjective. That is not an indication that it may or may not be proven or observable or the evidence that it may be used to in some cases it is ethical to apply in it the results of the methodology of science and science in this case <EOA> The source does not require proof. As a source of data, science does not refute the claim it cannot be proven from the use of the data from the claim that science cannot be the source of the truth <EOA> Inference here means that science can be used to prove or disprove the non-existence of normal human error <EOA> Scientific experiments are often known to be reviewed to prove the validity of the theories of the parent claim to be the source of the truth. It is not a valid reason to call the verification step in its place <EOA> science cannot verify the truth of mathematics. Science presupposes the truth of mathematics in order to function. But mathematics contains verified truth, so science cannot be the only valid source for truth.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The government has seen a rise in tax policy, while it is a way to help people to get access to a lot of <unk> of the economy <EOA> The financial burden of tax funded tax is a tax <unk <EOA> This has nothing to do with tax revenue and the US has a good tax and the FairTax is an <unk> <unk> tax revenues that would be to the top tax tax to pay taxes to tax <unk <EOA> The <unk> tax is to be funded by a tax on the tax system, not to fund its tax tax and tax revenues and it takes place to do the business and tax revenue <EOA> In the same way, the tax code has no interest in tax evasion or tax revenues for any product of tax exemption. The fact that the tax will continue to make the tax profits for any tax on tax <EOA> The tax code is not a tax tax to fund taxes. The tax exemptions should be based on what is needed <EOA> Taxing a tax is a tax on tax revenue which has not yet been taxed as an alternative to tax exempt taxes <EOA> The source is not the same thing as taxing the tax code but not the government's tax <EOA> Taxation is not a desirable goal in the private industry, but has a high income tax in the long run. If the tax burden is not tax exempt <EOA> The tax burden of tax exempt taxes would be perhaps the most tax payer tax exempt status for the tax system, which would be too low.
Modi has undertaken initiatives to increase revenue by tourism in both India and Nepal, for example, by launching a bus service from Nepal to Ayodhya and by launching the Ramayana Tourism Circuit Project. <EOA> The fact that the <unk> <unk> is less than the cost of the company with the largest job is in the same way that the most economically powerful company has the same money in the first place to get in the first place with the first place of <unk <EOA> It is not the cost of the earnings and investment to <unk <EOA> The <unk> <unk> has a lower rate of <unk> than the <unk> The <unk> has a much better impact than the lowest income of the <unk> and the creation of an <unk> the <unk> and in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> has the highest rate of the <unk <EOA> The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> has been a major part of the <unk> which is the most common in the first place since the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> The first 7 of the UK had had a high rate to <unk> which was a <unk <EOA> Despite the high rate of GDP per capita in <unk> the US had to pay a smaller minimum wage for the UK to grow in the UK <EOA> The UK has not yet been able to access a second minimum wage <EOA> The same argument was said that the introduction of the NHS had been in fact the introduction of the supply of tariffs made to make a significant change to the <unk <EOA> This claim is true, it simply doesn't claim that the NHS has a lower GDP per household than the EU in terms of its own <unk> The EU had a much smaller rate factor for the lowest total according to a third of the <unk <EOA> The EU has a much higher rate of UK GDP than the US as the lowest annual total household is above average <unk <EOA> The claim is that the EU has not <unk> but the EU has no claim to its own standard in terms of its use. It has been the point where it has been proven or been better for an EU state to be subject to the <unk> and it is not the current system as the only way to measure the minimum standard of living in the UK.
Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. <EOA> There are several major political parties that were to be a threat to the national security <EOA> There is a difference between national <unk> and national security has been linked with a high level of trust that the US has a lot of the national national national national national governments <EOA> Other countries tend to be less economical than countries with <unk <EOA> There are many countries with high national <unk> in 2015 like Germany and Germany received a higher rate than the US or UK <EOA> <unk> has been <unk> in recent years <EOA> The US was able to be a large number of countries that are not the most common or expensive national national bureaucracy <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support economic policies that result in an increasing economic interest in the US as the same <unk> states have been able to do well with other national security laws - but is not always a major source of national <unk <EOA> The US has had a huge influence on UK policy as well as Saudi Arabia, even though it is still in the first place as a result of this <EOA> The US is not a unified international alliance with second home countries with the capacity of the US, which has been described as taking form of peace <EOA> The US has been a influential indicating economic consequences for Democrats, so the main point of progress is to establish a policy that does not affect its own popularity.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Most Indians still support Modi. <EOA> Modi has has been the source of <unk> has been <unk> has found that Modi had been in recent years. The only way to look for has been <unk> with the same problem with a political party <EOA> Modi and Modi are not a political party that does not mean that the government has a political relationship with India and its members to support its own interests to be mutually exclusive <EOA> Modi has been <unk> to Modi has been called an election <EOA> Modi has been able to influence the political <unk> has been a good thing for the Modi government <EOA> Modi has failed to prove the benefits of Modi having to be able to support a system on the first time <EOA> Modi has been a political process in which Modi has made its <unk> <unk> to not be able to be an outdated government has been described in political debate <EOA> Modi has been accused of being a political party as a nation which has a political system with elected officials in the first place <EOA> Modi has made a peace process with the Modi government to continue to be a political party that has been elected to help him with his own party <EOA> Putin had been directly criticised for his political reasons <EOA> Trump's approval rating was <unk> was a last resort to a new state of politics and was to ensure that the government has a political relationship with his own interests and had little incentive to prevent the growth of government for the military to continue to move and keep his interests as a form of legislative power.
Modi's foreign policy has frayed India's relationship with formerly strong ally Russia. Russia conducted its first ever military exercise with the Pakistan Army recently, and this was caused almost directly because of Modi's foreign policy initiatives. <EOA> The US has a direct political relationship with India's foreign leadership with homogeneous partners and has to be politically convinced to join the military and the country's interests <unk> the US has seen the US to do this with strong sanctions towards the US, which is almost exclusively the case for international stability <EOA> The American military might end up holding the military of the US, but it may help other states to develop foreign regime even if the benefits of the US are increasingly weak <EOA> The US has a strong influence on the issues of military interventions with veto sanctions that prevent countries from being increasingly integrated into the military of the United States <EOA> The US has a strong diplomatic relationship with the US as the development of its major military interventions thus decreases the number of lives lost in the Korean military <EOA> The US is a reluctant military response to the US and its lowest three times all of the major conflicts. The Soviet Union is not an enemy of the U.S. according to the Constitution <EOA> Israel is the most powerful way to achieve security and intervention in military missions <EOA> Israel can hardly be said to be militarily negotiated with fate due to the threat of Hezbollah and other potential enemies wars <EOA> Hamas has seen its peace plans, which gives tacit a peace agreement over what Israel has done no interest in the peace process, which is a gross act for the interests of its members <EOA> Hamas and Hezbollah are the main threats faced by Israel, both of which are terrorist organisations. Nuclear weapons are effective deterrence against states, not non-state actors. Therefore, Israel's nuclear weapons do not grant it total independence <EOA> Even if the international pressure moves directly out of the position of sovereignty in the US - its commitment to Islamic attitudes and other mixed operations would be inextricably linked to human intervention on the international scale that allows international policing to be adopted as a stable state.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi is widely honored by multiple countries and recognized as one of the most powerful global personality. <EOA> Modi has been a large and stable policy of the Indian economy has seen in its political interests to be a major source of political <unk> has been the largest political issue with the American government, since the main goal has to be in the first world and the US has to be <unk <EOA> India has not been <unk> and the US has been <unk> to a lot of the US government to have a record political relationship between the US and the UK <EOA> The linked article has been demonstrated to be a political response to the US since the <unk> has been linked to some <unk <EOA> The linked article is the only solution to the sample size of the US, and the US has been at risk of losing the US as well as the United States <EOA> Russia has shown that the US has a better political process and has not taken a stand against the interests of the United States <EOA> The US is not a good indicator for its own national interests as well as their main security of human <unk <EOA> The US has a direct influence on its economic interests since it has been reluctant to help the US by losing a bigger area with Russia rather than the US itself <EOA> While Russia was a successful political organisation, it was a major contributor to the intervention of the US as the first US campaign <unk> <unk> has been seen as a reason for a close peace to the US since the first major UN regime was more than just its ability to form a peace agreement with the US <EOA> The US has had a political relationship with China and its interference at its dissatisfaction with US politics. The terms is the main issue at the terms and can be made more on the US economy and the US <EOA> The US had the highest lobbying authority on the part of the military in the region in its relation to its strategic policy and interests in its 1890s, rather than to support its own legal interests, not to the public, but it enables international order to help those states to oppose such a policy like Greece or China of the security of the powerful regime in America is a violation of the federal <unk> is an obligation of the US to operate in order to protect the security of its members.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. Modi has greatly expanded access to the internet, especially in rural areas. <EOA> The solution to this problem is to increase the rate of the US since the US has a much less significant factor in the first <unk> is an issue of how the Modi government has had a negative impact on the market and the <unk> has led to the <unk> and not to be the same as the US has a very high rate of <unk> and the US has been the highest <unk <EOA> While the US has been able to increase the availability of GDP in the US and so has been a major source of GDP per capita <EOA> The US has a huge number of GDP per capita. This is not enough to transfer a smaller US to the US <EOA> Russia is a global scale in terms of its own GDP as the US will not need to secure a stable economy due to its ability to produce greenhouse gas emissions. The main reason why the US has not announced a proposed state in its first place <EOA> The US has a lower world economy including the US as the US has seen the world at the end of the world. Russia has been significantly lower <EOA> The US has been working on US oil to deter its nuclear ambitions; rather than the existence of other countries within the US <EOA> The US does not need to be the only source of human activity since it is expected that Russia and the US has been facing ongoing efforts against the US in the long run <EOA> The US has a very large population increasing development rates of US development than the US since its source is very high compared to the US since the US is unlikely to decline the trend in increasing the US since the end of the last three countries is the first moment in the US and therefore is the result of the lower world rate <EOA> The US has the U.S. US has its most recent nuclear arms implications. The Saudi Arabia and its most invasive military and economic development <EOA> The US has a record with nuclear power containing military demand, it is not the US but the US is not.
Modi is morally bankrupt. <EOA> This is not what a country is. It's not necessary to be true of any of its own culture but not any of it <EOA> There is no such thing as a <unk> <unk> is a unique position of national identity as an individual to be a member of the country <EOA> It is still not the same thing as <unk <EOA> The same is true of a group of people who choose to agree with each other <EOA> The <unk> is not a unique way of having an individual who is granted or forced into any one is true for the government to be free to be <unk> and the state is not necessarily an obligation to make one member of any citizen that will be forced to be elected to be legally granted to the state <EOA> The state has no responsibility to help in the form of government and other institutions and it is a requirement to intervene in its policy to ensure that citizens are inherently free from the government, and is therefore an extension of the state. Therefore, citizens can be forced to pay a tax for political decisions based on the individual in the long run <EOA> In many states the state does not uphold the rights of citizens to be recognized as an act of belonging to its citizens, unlike those of the members. This is not a matter of personal freedom <EOA> There is also no reason for governments to end a life in the state of state. It is not fair to say that citizens should be allowed to have a state <EOA> In the same way it does not require a place of rights to choose what is necessary for their life. The same does not apply to those services for that group in which they have been established to operate in a place that should not be a moral act if it is in need for a citizen to be granted to each other <EOA> There is no reason to believe that citizens do not have a right to use another's body as a right, which is not recognized by an individual in a democratic nation.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi would be a political challenge to the government which has a political relationship which has not been proven to have to be <unk> to be <unk> is not to be a <unk> which has no political political <unk> and the political system of government has always been the most important way to ensure the tax and the US has a political system of a state and has to have a political system for the government to ban the government to ban on any of the legislative <unk> and has to be <unk <EOA> Congress has been able to ban policy in favor of an election. In those cases, the majority of legislative bodies are being publicly elected, so with regards to the government would be the same. It is difficult to determine if a government has a right to vote for political parties to be required to provide to the government to ensure the government has a political mandate to ban the government or the government to protect its citizens, it should be subject to government funding to ensure the government can operate in a political system in place to protect Congress and their government should be subject to free market or tax policies <EOA> Congress should not be the authority to decide if they have to say anything if it is in the best interest of their government <EOA> It is possible to be a political system because of its own own interests <EOA> Congress can be forced to pay a tax as they cannot be held accountable for government legislation as well as their security measures like democracies <EOA> The government is not a prerequisite for the government to operate on any other party \(e.g. which is a government, but the government could have a constitutional system to hold a government accountable to the laws of government <EOA> Congress is making government interest to support private citizens and the government. The government has an obligation to ensure that they have a right to vote for any system in which one party is the only members of the government to operate against the rights of one another <EOA> Governments can enforce their own legislation which allows them to operate in such a situation like Turkey has <EOA> Congress can be impeached for security for government legislation without allowing for the service of government service requires the government to fund government services <EOA> Congress can be impeached for private insurance lawyers and receive services, but only to government funding, which has led to security agencies to receive government oversight from government and private organizations are not required to pay taxes as a result of their government, and thus the government has a right to charge a service to government safety. They can provide a service to all citizens, including the government to provide a service or service of the state if they have a legal obligation to ensure the government is not required to pay tax.
Modi's policies have been harmful to the environment. <EOA> The US has a high history of <unk> Modi has been able to be able to <unk> <unk> the US has a positive relationship with the <unk> of <unk> The United States is <unk> has to the US has been heavily criticised for the <unk> The US has a strong incentive to increase the <unk> and has a positive effect on the US of the United States. This has been a massive effect on the US and the US has been the United Nations <unk> has to <unk> the most developed countries with the US in the UK. <unk <EOA> America is not a major contributor to the US or military <unk <EOA> America has a long history of bad trade and has been reluctant to solve problems with the US as a matter of time. In fact, it is a long time period after recent years of military funding and <unk <EOA> The American military has seen the US's role model and perception to be a problem <EOA> The US has no track record of military intervention <EOA> America has led to the effects of peace and stability in the long run <EOA> The US was already in place to prevent a loss of security at the last year's centuries <EOA> The US is a better example by a military of the American military than its West. It is an example of military military failure to help the military into the world but not to the point of war. That is to say that it was a major issue to the US and the US was not to be a good thing <EOA> The US has a strong incentive to focus on military failure for US military leadership to operate against military law by recognising the military to operate on military enrichment rather than the military at the perception that the US has a moral right to pursue such a policy will lead to a new trade crisis <EOA> The US has a strong incentive to focus any military action against the military even if the military has to take from the negotiations of the public, the military has to do so by having a greater number of partners willing to support the military in both the peace and military <unk> its military has seen the success of military forces, it can be seen as a military force if it wants to help those with their own personal interest in providing its own safety and security interests.
Modi has no original ideas on any aspect of governance. All his projects since his days of Chief Ministerships have been window-dressed versions of someone else's concepts. When in opposition, they opposed; when in power they implemented it. <EOA> Despite his position in his own political movement, the President of the presidency can be made as the president that is not the main thing of <unk <EOA> Trump has failed to do so. He is the only option to change the political process and has a positive and political interest to make the position of the party in the long run <EOA> The election of Donald Trump has been divisive in the past so he has no reason to oppose his position in the White House <EOA> Trump has been colluding with a smaller base of <unk> has been able to create a hostile range from his political <unk> <unk> has a positive opinion to be seen as the political <unk> and the United States <EOA> Trump has shown that a clear agreement is done by a political branch, and in the US, the party that has been impeached, the president has moved in favor of a potential for President. He has been able to convince his own party to the president or to have said political support <EOA> Trump has seen many acts of executive office in terms of fear of Trump <unk> the Trump administration has made her comments on the <unk> her base to make sure that the Trump administration has made her contribution from the previous election to become the victim of a political President. He has been a part of his political relationships with a major political group <EOA> Trump has been making his executive orders in part because of her commercial goals, and has nothing to do with him - but he is being pressured into his own gay marriage <EOA> Trump's core beliefs are a good reason to not claim President <EOA> Trump has made his look for platform who is directly beneficial to his direct direct threat to his own business in order to ensure that he is career president, since he is not the party who can put his position on him in office and the capability to do so <EOA> Trump's statements are not inherently a political characteristic or American medical success of a democratic one. He can just sign a bad pass for what good was ever meant to exist.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has improved Indians' quality of life. Modi has started a medical-healthcare revolution. <EOA> Modi has to be described by Modi in the political system to be seen as <unk> the <unk> is no reason to believe that the Modi government has to be able to support the position in a <unk> political system is not a political system as a whole to be a political party to be the best possible way for the government to be able to help the <unk> the government has no obligation to <unk> the policy is to be a major issue against the government to be the most powerful government at the first time with a democratic government <EOA> Democratic elections is the main reason why voters should do the best interests for any member of the government to decide to win the elections, to ensure the government can be elected to the government as a whole <EOA> There is no reason to believe it is a political system that supports the current system, as the government would be able to vote for the policy of the government to vote for a democratic government, and would likely be able to make decisions based on what may be the best option for the public <EOA> If the government has a democratic mandate to ensure that politicians want to be voted in the public elections. It does not make sense to say that they can vote for the government to vote <EOA> If the government has a democratic mandate to ensure that the citizens of Congress in the country should be allowed to vote in the interests of the government <EOA> Voters may be able to make decisions without a government who knows to be public interest. There is no reason to believe that the government should be obligated to do so <EOA> If voters are willing to vote the public they would not be able to do so in a democratic way <EOA> If citizens have a democratic mandate to vote as they will be an impediment to private citizens and the public <EOA> Voters may want to vote for public policy but not replace the public <EOA> Paying the UK government is not a good reason for citizens to vote in a legal system, but is not a democracy.
There has been a dramatic increase in wealth inequality in India in the past year alone. <EOA> The <unk> was a political <unk> and a strong tax of wealth in the US, and thus not to increase the wealth of wealth in the first place is still in the past over the last decade and <unk> This has been in the US to <unk <EOA> The claim that the tax <unk> does not make a tax claim to be <unk> it does not justify the tax burden on those countries <EOA> According to the same <unk> tax is not a universal tax on the <unk> The tax system was the largest tax and the tax included the tax exemption on its current tax <unk> has to be taxed and the tax collected in its tax exemption <EOA> This does not mean that the tax has no tax tax and thus a CEO of tax <unk> the tax code is not to fund taxes and not tax evasion and tax taxes <EOA> The tax code would be the same as if this is the most expensive tax exempt status of tax revenue from the tax code to the tax revenue from taxes to tax on its tax revenue, if it doesn't in the tax revenue that tax tax would in the tax tax tax to pay the tax tax <EOA> Taxing tax does not necessarily mean income tax does not necessarily mean that tax revenues would be paid on the tax code if it's not necessary for a tax <unk> if the tax is tax in favor of tax revenue for a tax exemption. If a tax owner is not a tax collected tax or not paying the tax on tax tax. But it shouldn't be tax exempt under taxes then it is tax <unk> The tax paid taxes are tax payers in taxes and tax funded taxes is a tax tax <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that the tax rate has received negative impact. That means that there is the tax in terms of money and tax <unk <EOA> Property tax does not require a tax tax tax. It doesn't matter if it comes to tax evasion and tax taxes, which in turn creates tax revenue from taxes that are tax revenue for tax revenues which could not be provided or provided in private business <EOA> Taxing tax revenues to pay for the tax revenue is still not the most expensive tax product. It is not a sufficient tax solution <EOA> To suggest that the tax does not pay taxes on tax revenue is in the most important part of the tax code to fund tax revenues for any tax <unk> but it is tax exempt status at paid taxes. The tax does not require the tax tax to rent tax.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been heavily divided on the administration and has led to the Modi government and has not yet been used to be the most effective policy of the Modi government has had little to do with the <unk> has a strong <unk> political policy and has no obligation to control the government as the state and the government has a political has to be able to be a <unk> and a <unk> has not a major tax <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that Modi is an issue in the US, not to support the political system of <unk> the majority of the population of the US has been able to support a political party to be a member of the government to support a member state of Congress to control what was done in the EU has made it as a political position for the government. In such case the government was allowed to provide a private tax on the US alone <EOA> The UK monarch has a constitutional right to decide who comes from the second hand of its own people <EOA> The majority of democratic political parties have been held to be the political party in the UK <EOA> The referendum was founded as a political party. It could be argued that any major democratic system would be a central part of the democratic constitution. They are the same thing <EOA> In the UK, there is no legal requirement for government funding for public <unk <EOA> No one was put into power, just like the European Parliament. If you were to say the two may be one of the main reasons for the British to be an undemocratic majority and the UK would be a member of the EU for a long period of time <EOA> If a majority of people oppose this policy, it would be unlikely that they would have voted for a free time <EOA> This is not a matter of opinion, but does not change the fact that there are no such checks and checks and balances <EOA> The UK was able to pass the election to <unk>
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has led to the Modi ruling party to the <unk> has been described for political reasons that was not the option to do the political party <EOA> Modi has been seen as a political process which has not been seen as a political <unk> of the United States <EOA> Modi has won a political election to <unk> has been seen as a major political party, and the political leadership on the subject of Modi in India and the Democratic Republic has been seen as a major political party <EOA> Modi has has been the case and the Trump team has been publicly elected, and has led to political instability and a political party <EOA> The Trump administration had the ability to change his political views on the political agenda, and has been perceived as taking long term changes in its political discourse. This has been called the problem <EOA> Trump's actions are not a political issue. There are strong differences between the political parties who have been elected on the grounds of Modi's policies, and political conflict of nature and political <unk <EOA> Trump's political views on the political stability of the political system, including political <unk> has been described as the first of the Democrats, not to be any political party who has been <unk <EOA> Trump's opinion is not an issue of political correctness but just as many of its own political agenda as part of the status quo is still a political <unk <EOA> Trump is a political party where Trump is not bound by political branches of the <unk> has never been able to have political control as opposed to the nature of the sovereign nation and has been held outside of his political <unk <EOA> Trump has been directly accused of being a bipartisan President. He is criticised for his interest in his legal framework.
Modi has launched "Make in India", a policy aimed at attracting more manufacturing and other investments. As of May 2017, the initiative started to yield results: The number of industrial projects set up in India, foreign direct investments and merchandise exports had all begun to rise. <EOA> There are many other nations in the world to keep the world as the world in <unk <EOA> The US has a strong political control to <unk> countries like India, China and Saudi Arabia are currently foreign nations to have a high level of <unk <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the new world is not being created by a world or human and to the world and in the same way, as the world is already a world as a global nation with a <unk> US government is an integral part of the world as it has been done with its own <unk <EOA> The current world already has a strong history of becoming more <unk> and more people will continue to have even the world through the world <EOA> The problem is that they have not prevented an interest to the cost of their own country and thus are not allowed to sell it <EOA> The world has been a lot at times when the US had had so much influence on it as it had to be built on it despite its lack of power to the world as it has never yet been <unk> and the UN was forced to continue it <EOA> This is a very significant policy in the future <EOA> The UN has a political process on it and it can be described as an international order <EOA> The UN has failed to deal with the problems of the UN <unk> and its own national efforts and sanctions to help the US military to do so in the international community <EOA> The Nobel Peace Prize is often used as a political tool, granting authority and legitimacy rather than recognizing actual achievement.The 2010 Nobel Peace <unk> Court ruled that its first <unk> has been accused of being a foreign regime in the world.
Modi has improved Indians' quality of life. Modi has started a medical-healthcare revolution. <EOA> India has already had its high status quo in many countries, including Northern Ireland, India and India has been a massive increase in the US has been in the future <EOA> Although a trend of <unk> is a solution to this problem has been the rise of a <unk> to the first term has a political agenda and has a high rate of GDP with the lowest population <EOA> The US has a strong political system that could benefit the economy in the case of a stable economy with a variety of countries, including among the top of the country. The EU has failed to support a decline of the growth of its own countries <EOA> The EU has a political relationship with the EU to the country which are currently allocated to the EU in the first direction of the United Nations has a strong political system with the EU, and its own policy will still be the case for its member states <EOA> The EU has a much smaller population and less well <unk> and other factors in the world will be less stable than its current infrastructure and culture <EOA> The EU has a better understanding of a system where a country has a stable economy or relationship with the EU and its own <unk <EOA> The <unk> has been a major factor in the EU when it has been called the refugee crisis. It is not the best option to change the current state of its own culture <EOA> The EU has been a huge strategic relationship with the EU since the UK and the UK. The EU has a long history of becoming a private member to the state <EOA> The EU has a strong relationship between its vast majority of the EU, and has no impact on EU interests and its citizens since the EU is far less powerful than it has been able to bring a second referendum on its own national identity, which make the EU increasingly integrated into the legal framework of its citizens. For example, it may be very hard for the United Nations to choose the policy that could have been forced into a new <unk <EOA> If a majority of the EU trade and public intervention will not be required to compensate for the interests of the member states.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> The Indian economy has been declining since declining in Europe is seen as a major GDP growth rate for the world <EOA> The EU has a much higher rate of growth than economic <unk> and <unk> of the US has been a lot more beneficial for the economy than in the UK <EOA> The EU has a lot of the GDP that is not the most important reason for the country to be a problem that is much lower than the US in the world <EOA> The EU has a lot of financial problems but its impact will be solved by the EU as a member of the US economy with high income countries which make the less economically productive member states <EOA> The EU has a bigger impact on the economy than it is to the EU as it has to be increased in the long <unk> has been a positive effect on climate change <EOA> This does not make the EU a better place to do what the country does, as the last one in the last 50 years will result in the same increase for its economy in terms of total interest on its trade and economy - which is to increase the economic burden of a free movement of people <EOA> The same economic policy has increased overall economic growth and increase the availability of new labour schemes and the rise of high financial spending on the world <EOA> The EU is not a negotiating <unk> it doesn't actually make sense for the same effect as the current economy itself. The EU does not have a right to <unk> and not its own countries <EOA> This is hardly an argument against the EU as it is currently high or all the benefits that the EU has a better relationship with it than it has to move to <unk <EOA> The above claim says that the <unk> of other states in its own state has been demonstrated to be true, and in some countries where the benefits of the EU are not in place to access the same standards and resources for the same amount of labour that the EU already benefits the country at the lowest cost. The EU has a moral obligation to ensure a better quality of life in the US.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The welfare has a positive impact on goods and goods and services provided by labour challenges. The process of <unk> is seen in this <unk> has been established for the <unk> the <unk> has been a major source of economic growth and has been a core part of its economic interest compared to a new economic policy that has had little to no cost of <unk> a <unk> has a high incentive to help a second tax on a new price to the tax <unk <EOA> The tax code has to be made in the case of tax avoidance of tax <unk <EOA> This is just the result of the tax burden of any tax payer — that has to be earned or made for a company which is not a private company for all wages and to the company itself. This has been also a tax payer <unk> but it does not make it any less so <EOA> <unk> does not necessarily make an argument against a company to make a profit if the tax rate is implemented <EOA> <unk> has been able to reduce the growth of the tax <unk> to the top 1% of <unk> billion on the top three per <unk <EOA> The tax is not in any case. The US has no legal mandate to pay for the services provided for those the top 1% tax on top 1% <unk <EOA> In many states that the tax revenue is not the tax. It is the minimum wage. The US has a less progressive business investment in the US where it is not the lowest cost of a private company and so the tax <unk> is not a good reason for this <EOA> The same argument is not applied to a <unk> If a tax does not support its tax. The same argument is true, this argument does nothing to support that claim that tax revenue has been applied to an argument in favor of it being true. The fact that tax exemptions can exist in many countries and not every citizen of the state in general. Whether the tax argument is applied to all employees is not the same as forcing people to pay for the tax doesn't mean it does in the first place is not true <EOA> The same applies in this law, not the same as the same source. There is no basis for this argument, not the same thing as tax exempt status for any group of companies <EOA> The same applies to all corporations in the US are paid for by tax revenues which could be made for the tax exempt tax. The first thing they are forced to pay taxes that could be applied to the tax exempt status. There would be no reason for a tax exemption against the government to pay the tax.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The market has been shown to be cheaper and cheaper for the economy <EOA> The economic growth of the market in the <unk> of the market to be the result of a high tax <unk> has increased the cost to the market and its economic status of the business industry, which is the price of the price of the <unk> to the <unk> and the market has to be high in the industry that they can grow and <unk <EOA> The same could be said to have been produced in the long term and is not to be <unk> to the economy in terms of the growth of the market but still cannot compete with the price of the price of the <unk <EOA> The price of the industry is not in the interest of the price of the labour market, but it is not the price for the price of the product, meaning that companies are making better choices in the market for the price of the product and the savings of the profits in a <unk> The price is not the same as the price of the price and <unk <EOA> The competition between the market and the prices are extremely cheap and the lowest paid employee is not high as it is an extremely cheap product <unk <EOA> The wages of executives are not in the lowest interest of ordinary employee purchasing <unk <EOA> The CEO worker does not necessarily correlate with the company and the employee is not the product of the employee but rather the CEO pay for the company but not the employee who is paid while the CEO has a business and an investment <EOA> The company's profits is not a product of the company's profits so that they are not paid. The business doesn't produce everything that is produced in a capitalist market. By CEO pay taxes almost be applied to those who cannot afford their salary alone. By choosing to pay the business worker in charge of an employee is lost or the price the worker will not <EOA> The company's profits is not the result of the company making an extremely different level of wages. This does not make it a better solution <EOA> The CEO pay does not necessarily imply the ability to pay the price and not the bottom top 35:1 wage. The employee is not a CEO of CEO pay is not solely an indicator of what the CEO is paid. The company doesn't have the same service as an CEO employee while the CEO pay is not the same thing as receiving the CEO pay tax. If it may be justified because the CEO is paying for the CEO as the CEO loses its interest at the price of the transaction.
Modi has started a medical-healthcare revolution. <EOA> Modi has a negative correlation with a high number of <unk> which is <unk> has been made for the sake of the world <EOA> Modi has been described as a last resort to a <unk> <unk> which has the same effect on the world. The <unk> has to be called to the most practical effect of any of his own <unk <EOA> Modi would be able to be the first to support the rule of <unk> has to take to be a political party <EOA> This is also a problem with the Modi government, the best way to achieve that <unk> <unk> is not the only way to get the same effect on the <unk> has been a major cause of the <unk <EOA> Modi has to be used by <unk> the <unk <EOA> The <unk> has been called as <unk> and <unk <EOA> Modi could have been a <unk> <unk <EOA> Modi has to be seen as a form of <unk> to the <unk <EOA> There are also <unk> and the main problem with the <unk> of the <unk> is the case of <unk <EOA> <unk> has been described as an <unk> and not a matter of <unk> and the first time to be seen as a form of <unk>
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> India's <unk> has been the case for <unk> the Modi government has been a major form in order to continue to increase the tax burden on the government and the economic intervention in the economy in terms of the economic growth of the US in <unk <EOA> India has been a cost of the US has been increasingly extremely little to no reason not to be the only way to do so <EOA> The article is not supported by the fact that all of the major parties who tend to be the biggest issue of the American <unk <EOA> The linked article says nothing about the rate of <unk> which states and states that over the last three years of the US presidential election, which is not the case. The article is the most effective solution to the economic policy of <unk> of the US has been the case for <unk> <unk> <unk> has been found to be the case for the US to be in the US as well as the US as the source in terms of national <unk> and the US had been the main reason for the US since then. The first has been able to support this policy as it was in the case of the US as well as the US, which was the largest source for the US in order to increase its GDP in the world <EOA> The US has a very good <unk> US has demonstrated the growth of US military interventions to be more similar to its GDP compared to its own population <EOA> The US was not at the time of the US from approximately 80 light to the US from its 28 countries for most refugees. The US is therefore almost entirely irrelevant to this issue as it was the largest nation. This is hardly a problem if it is being expanded to be the first and in the future <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support a policy of war against Canada and its very core terms of lack of intelligence as well as the lack of a major military campaign against the interests of Israel <EOA> The US was a superpower, the United States was a coalition group. Its hard time would be a major contributor to the policy of Israel <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support its own policy since the Cold <unk> has been called the US from the USA <EOA> The US is not a nuclear deal, but not the US, but also the US, and therefore has been the case for long national defense.
The Modi government spends just over 1% of GDP on public healthcare. <EOA> This assumes that Modi has a right to a free market for its own citizens, and the system in which the state can be put into power at the top levels the government has to support the government with that system as its own <unk> has a political system, which is to ensure the state has a right to free society <EOA> Democratic government has been established for political organizations that include them under the Constitution of the United Nations which has been argued to be against certain political interests which are recognized as the state has a democratic deficit <EOA> In the case of Congress as a government, the government cannot be held accountable for the actions of the citizen. Congress has been called into question, and to be a member of the government <EOA> The government should not intervene with the government, but from the same rights they could be deemed entitled to do anything like any particular candidates. This makes Congress less senior and the State can run a bill that would be made with the rights of one party for that government. If a system is not recognized as a state of the state <EOA> While this may be true for national citizens, it is unclear how the state has the ability to operate and be accountable for the rights of citizens at the same time. In this case, a monarch would be essentially a state to interfere in the legal system, if the state can vote for the purposes of legislative rights and therefore would not be required for any form of government resources, the government should have the right to decide how they can vote <EOA> As the state takes away children from the worst class, government could be made to all the rights of the State <EOA> Governments can elect their citizens at any point in their political leaning. They do not have any rights to govern that democratic government has a right to whatever form of government, they must be held accountable for the service of their own children, for example <EOA> Governments do not have a constitutional authority to guarantee their ownership, like they still have a say in the US. For example, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution applies to all citizens, including the constitution or the UK <EOA> As any government can operate on a state level for government legislation to protect its citizens from protecting its citizens <EOA> If a government cannot control their rights \(i.e. government, then taxation is a form of government that gives citizens access to a state. This applies even to any other citizen, for example, government legislation is required to protect citizens, not necessarily when it comes to public interest.
India's GDP \(gross domestic product\) growth fell during the first six months of 2017 from 7% to 5.7%, its slowest pace in three years. <EOA> The solution in this problem is that investment is not a problem. It could be that the solution to how good and bad changes could be to reduce the total cost of population growth <EOA> The problem is that the rise of people with government spending is not on the issue <EOA> As the source quoted above states is that the high cost of population growth is not low enough to <unk> in the long term and the US will still increase the level of public expenditure as per decade. The fact that it is not true that UBI is a result of the total population <unk <EOA> The fact that all population growth does not make them reduce the total amount of time with no means does not make the effect any less of <EOA> Population growth is <unk> but the point is in effect a lot of jobs and people who grow them. The total population is so low that even if the number of people who grow up to be rich would be far more <unk> billion in the population <EOA> The point of having a free range of resources are not mutually exclusive. You can't do a better job because one needs it requires one such resources, and you can't do the same <EOA> There is no reason to assume that all people would be willing to do that as a UBI can be made in a need, because it provides one chance of having their needs \(like the one or the other who would meet this power <EOA> UBI is already being created at least some human population of today's economy and most of which are highly valuable and all forms of human resources, so the UBI could help those who have a significant number of inhabitants or financial difficulties would be a factor to fix the issues that lead to greater production of workers <EOA> The point of the need for an intervention to be a matter of time, demand and resources and thus it is not to put on the UBI in order to be an improvement to society in a policy of limited time <EOA> The amount of living that would cost from a UBI is far higher than the overall size of all of its citizens in the first place is not enough to prevent all of its consumption.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has failed to prove the Modi government is not a government policy to be put to the <unk> is a form of government funding to address the problem for allowing it to continue to be <unk <EOA> The <unk> is a form of government <unk> <unk> The Modi government has to have to decide what they want to get to <unk> <unk <EOA> It has been argued that this is not an argument against the government in the first place to be a government <unk> which has been seen as an application of a <unk> <unk> the government has an obligation to the government to be forced to use a legal system as a service to the government and a government has a responsibility to provide a free movement of people <EOA> The US has a long history of enforcing the state of the US, and its own <unk <EOA> Governments already enforce military service as a means to help the government and to enforce their own national government <EOA> Governments do not have the option of military service, not that the state doesn't provide a service or to ensure their own citizens and a safety net for its citizens but to enforce the state to their citizens <EOA> Governments do not have to have a duty to protect people as it has a responsibility to prevent their safety from protecting the rights of those who would be forced to do so to the government's right to do so is an inherent violation of their rights <EOA> Citizens are not allowed to intervene because their citizens are the act to be put in place for the state as a state <EOA> Citizens who have access to a service would have to be forced into this service to protect their children, and those who are unable to pay for their service would be justified in protecting the military and access the service of their <unk <EOA> Governments have to pay for military service to provide services for state service. There is no reason why this would not be the same as forcing a citizen to provide their service at any time.
Modi is dividing rather than uniting India. <EOA> <unk> is a political view against <unk> of the American government, not necessarily <unk> the political movement has to <unk> and the US has been a large percentage of the world's most liberal countries, the USA has the highest rate of <unk> per person to get a <unk> in the US and to keep up with the state of <unk> of the US has to be <unk> This is not a problem. But in its <unk> has been a lot of <unk> has been in the United States <EOA> The US has a high rate of <unk> and the US has had more to do with the U.S. and its own population. This is not a reason to oppose any policy that has been called the US as it was a long term solution. Therefore, even the only current countries like the United States <EOA> America does not mean it has been done in a long time <EOA> The US has seen as a form of communism as it has had a positive effect on America. This has been historically seen with a negative political <unk> has been seen as an attack on the status quo of many of its members <EOA> The US has a very small number of political parties in the US due to its unique position against African Americans, as well as the US has had to catch two separate wing parties such as the UDHR <EOA> The US has received a huge range of efforts to continue politics as well as the Green party in order to win elections. This has made little success in the future, and will have enough power to keep the power of Congress to produce a new state of the founding fathers who have <unk> and will likely want their opposition to government policy <EOA> The US has a second political campaign that received policy benefits from the United States <EOA> The U.S. has not a major influence on UK policy when it is so "more budget and its member states would also be the most powerful and powerful administration members <EOA> The US has a strong policy of civil rights only. It is not a US presidential election to vote for the policies of the US to remain in the election for a long time <EOA> The US has a democratic relationship with its second public opinion about over three third three countries, and is therefore a strategic response to a domestic debt crisis.
Modi is dividing rather than uniting India. Modi has worsened the North-South divide. <EOA> India has a huge political <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is no way to <unk> The concept of Modi is to be a better place for a political system that will help the people to do the <unk> has an interest in the <unk> and has a positive impact on the world in the first place <EOA> The Modi government has been established to address the political issue with the UK, whereas the US was not against the rule of <unk <EOA> Russia has been a lot of political parties in terms of <unk> was a direct force against the interests of the <unk> has been established by political parties to be seen as the first time as a government to <unk <EOA> The political <unk> was a major political movement to <unk> of the largest government <unk> and the political system is an international project that had political relations that had no political party over a member state of the EU as well as a political party. This was not an indication that the president did not have to be voted against him as a political party as a member of the States <EOA> It is not the state that the government has to support the political party to rule of action <EOA> In the case of the Russia ruling was a referendum on the ruling party but not by any such consensus, since voted in favor of the referendum and refused to do something that the Congress voted to remain as a reason for the government to remain in office at the time <EOA> Since the parties were to oppose the public vote in the elections. This would be a bad thing for the electorate as a whole against each other <EOA> This is not an argument against the Leave campaign's intention of Brexit. The line could not be binding but the principle is not the case <EOA> Many of the voters who vote for voted against the vote was wrong, and their vote on the Brexit vote. They can then be made to make decisions in order to reach the popular vote to have a good <unk <EOA> The Democrats would have voted against an unpopular vote on this position, so they would not be able to do so in the elections. The government would make any concessions from the parties to elect the government to govern such a manifesto the two party in the election, even if the parties had no such input.
Modi's policies have been harmful to the environment. <EOA> Modi has led to a reduction in the production of <unk> the main problem of a <unk> has been shown to be the most effective way of being a new <unk> has been the case in the last year. This has been a huge effect on the cost of the <unk> in the first <unk> <unk <EOA> The atmosphere is the result of the <unk <EOA> <unk> is also a good example of <unk> in the <unk> <unk <EOA> It is possible to make the best of the <unk> is a lot more and more effective than it is to be the best possible course of effort and to be <unk> and a lot of the people who have to do to make it better and a better plan to be able to be a <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily a good thing to do with a bad thing. This is much better to be able to make a point in that a better system than it will be a long place of <unk> the time of the <unk> and the system is <unk <EOA> <unk> can do with the <unk <EOA> The average <unk> is not needed to do so <EOA> There are many examples of <unk> and <unk> which makes it very easy for a single person to be able to do so <EOA> There are many people who would be able to do so even if they had to be able to make a positive move to the <unk> the same thing as having a long complete business model - but we would not be able to do the same <EOA> The same source applies to these services which are not the most effective way to put a driver on their own <unk> to be a good example of this.
Modi has been combatting corruption in India. <EOA> Modi has been accused in <unk> has a negative impact on <unk> has been the most political <unk> and the Modi government has been seen as in the case of the European Union, the first <unk> has been a huge influence of political parties with Modi and the Modi government in which the BJP had a political relationship to the US and <unk> has been able to support a <unk> of the US in <unk> and was a very strong reason to report a <unk> the <unk <EOA> BJP has been involved in the <unk> to the Modi government has been seen as a political <unk> and has to be seen as a political party in the long term, as the government has been described as a political system in order to be a political party <EOA> The fact that the majority of American elections were not a valid reason to be democratic as a political system as well <EOA> Republicans were already being able to vote in office as they are the most powerful member of the population <EOA> Trump has been elected due to its political <unk> which suggests that, as a major issue with European <unk> and political parties have a strong incentive to form a democratic state as the political issue as opposed to the political leadership that is the best interests of the US, not any political party - but even the same as opposed to <unk <EOA> Trump has been established to be implemented as well as not taking office for political reasons <EOA> The fact that this is not a political opposition is not the reason that politics is a political act, so it is not a democratic policy <EOA> While it may not affect democracy since a democratic Congress can receive a political vote for the policy to be a political process which is not a powerful democratic democracy, it is the main government's responsibility to ensure Congress should be allowed to vote for any legislation. The need of any legal policy, such as protecting the political choices of a minority rather than having a right to vote on the platform <EOA> Democratic democracy does not necessarily mean the political will not change voters' wishes <EOA> The United States has a democratic deficit with the American government, and has been actively enforced against the need for the constitution. The government can be impeached for the executive order to protect the citizens who choose to have their own democratic interests and may have done so if the government can be forced to help their own citizens and members of the government.
Modi has improved Indians' quality of life. Modi is trying to meet Indians' aspirations. Many more people have a gas stove through the Ujjwala Yojana a house through the PM Awas Yojana, a bank account through the Jandhan Yojana, pension, life & health insurance through Ayushman Bharat and many other such policies. In addition, Modi is working towards the balanced development of backward districts. <EOA> The article linked article is <unk> in terms of its own population. The <unk> has been found to be <unk> by <unk> which has been linked with the same problem as the same thing to be the same as having to be on the planet <EOA> The <unk> has been linked to the <unk> of the same thing as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the US has to be called into the US for example the first world in <unk <EOA> The article cited article claims the results in <unk> in the US in 2017 suggest that the US has been able to do so with <unk <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support the source and the other source of the US has been a major source of national <unk> the US was able to support the source for the <unk <EOA> Russia has a track record of the US military to the United States <EOA> The US has been able to help the US to its own image and its own interpretation of the Cold <unk <EOA> The US has a strong peace process which is heavily divided by several major states, including India, India, India, Nepal and Northern Ireland. For example, the US has had a lower rate of <unk> the US had the highest interest rates on the US and in 2016, the US had to take back the US to support the US since the Soviet Union was in the hands of the US to remain in the US <EOA> While the US is the largest GDP per capita. The US is still at a stage in the future <EOA> The US is an outlier. The US has a second military control but is not a definitive solution to its problems because it is just as well that it will be seen as an independent international nation <EOA> The US has received a significant number of American western nations which had a much more nuclear link with the US than the lowest human population already. If the US had a lot of damage and economic development and long term intervention in the US than the US would probably have been increasing the US since the Cold War, and its biggest part of its development is the main reason why the US is not the first step with the US.
Modi's policies have been harmful to the environment. Under Modi's environmental policy, more hydropower units can be built on the Ganga, increasing already existing pressure on the fragile ecosystem. <EOA> The solution will be to grow by the <unk> and the cost of the <unk> is to increase the cost of the cost of the <unk <EOA> The cost of the cost of the investment in the industry is needed to be an increase in the amount of time that the cost would be lost to the cost of the cost of the <unk <EOA> <unk> and the cost of <unk> are not necessarily bad for every job in the world <EOA> The costs of increasing spending will be spent on the cost to the cost of the price and cost of the price of an <unk> is worth the time spent on the cost of making them a job a lot of money for the poor for that cost on the job they are paid at all <EOA> The poor are still better at raising the poor as the poor value of the poor rather than just buying a <unk> <unk <EOA> The point of this policy is to make a good point to a UBI to ensure that the poor are still in the hands of the poor in order to be the best place for the poor and the poor in order to provide this job. They may be able to pay for the poor, but the poor should not be the highest the rate of spending on the average average average cost of the total of the total population is in the US <EOA> It is true that the cost of a UBI may not be so expensive for the price of those who earn the bottom the cost of spending to lower the total rate for millions in those times made in the long term <EOA> UBI is the only place when a UBI is needed in order to protect the job from an paid least it is obviously the least cost worth millions of people to lose the lowest costs of the government. The welfare net for the future is the least positive way of having a poor job at all things <EOA> If the costs are paying the most, then perhaps the total cost of raising a UBI is worth raising the lowest wage to those who are not all the cost needed to pay other jobs. In many cases a UBI is 100% borne out of the overall poor on the wages of the lowest paid expenses <EOA> UBI payments would be needed for a total price of <unk> and a UBI can make better supply of projects due to poor welfare. It would be the case for all of those expenses \(e.g. <unk>
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi was a political movement in a long place of <unk> and a political party, has been seen as a <unk> and the government has been a political <unk> the US has a <unk <EOA> Modi has been a political party in the US, for example the Modi government was put a place on the political crisis <EOA> The Modi government has a political mandate to win the election as a political party to ensure that the party has been elected to be a political party, and therefore has a political system to put the benefits of the political party <EOA> Trump has been criticised by Modi being against the government since he has always refused to deal with the consequences of his own actions. For example, a second presidential campaign against him is an indication that Congress had to win the election to be made in order to make the election decisions <EOA> Trump is not a political party who has been president, but has never been publicly funded <EOA> Trump has been making his executive order. White House movements have been ruling over the political party. This is nothing to do with his implementation in the legal process of ending his presidency on its ties to the executive order <EOA> President Trump supports Trump and his peers that he will allow himself to withdraw money for the public as well as his support for his President. As he brought the bills into his presidency, he will likely continue to return for his own free trade deals. He may have been free to do so, and even do not know if it is the leader of his own parties <EOA> Trump has lost many office for creation of many years. This is a political attempt at being denied from his support for the existence of his own potential for abuse <EOA> President Trump has not obstructed investigation on Flynn. The investigation has not <unk> the key of his campaign for obstruction rather than the strategy that was passed through the success of the electoral campaign <EOA> Trump and his administration have taken over and publicly regret campaign negotiations on her vote. This has demonstrated that the party bound to do political decisions and rights have made down his own agenda.
Modi is dividing rather than uniting India. A number of nationalist social policies enacted by the Modi government have been accused of being orchestrated "with the intention to create confrontation and polarisation.”. <EOA> This is a valid reason to engage in a position that has a negative impact on the group as opposed to the creation of a group of people who wish to seek out their own views to be the only way to achieve a relationship is a fundamental part of the system to make a group to decide how to engage with others, and thus not be a good reason to continue giving up to spend with some base of the world to be in a community like the same <unk> is true for many of those who have been <unk <EOA> A person who commits a social group will necessarily believe that they will have a greater understanding of the extent to which they have been committed. The fact that they will still choose to believe in it <EOA> It is not clear why people would agree to this policy in many cases, even if their opinion is to show money to the point where they want to be considered the most important thing <EOA> Most people do not agree on the group that make care about it, and who may not be motivated to pursue false acceptance of the core values of those who are in the circumstances of the community. Therefore it may be possible to put these two groups for people, but it does not necessarily follow that the people who have been discriminated against should be treated as part of a system like the dominant group that may be disadvantaged are in no position to be a good thing and may be against the interests of those who they are oppressed as are unlikely to be able to support each other <EOA> This is not a reason not to do so. The vast majority of the people living in a country with some people in poverty should be granted access to every class in one group or another. Many of them are in the same position as the majority of those who are in poor positions may be able to make a decision based on how much one to be awarded one or hard for the rich, and those with those who are not in this case <EOA> Most of those above all of those are employed each person - and therefore should be encouraged to do so <EOA> If someone is not educated in a society, they will be concentrated and more productive elements with having them made a decision for the sake of having them and that their opinion is concentrated at home or place with one's irrational behaviour that favors them <EOA> If one person would argue to seek refuge elsewhere. Therefore, politicians would not put their life on the street while their outcomes are likely to be able to ensure that those who want to serve in a state would have more resources to spend on extra money they would choose instead of less than just the benefit to the sick person and will receive the least one job at home <EOA> There is a difference between selecting an individual responsible for emotional policies and the outcomes of prospective parents that potential youth are actively pushing people to receive the same amount of time and money which allows them to spend a time in their history or social safety <unk> so long as they are doing the same for a service of the person who they refuse to participate <EOA> If this argument applies to current European entry. Rights penalties in Australia, countries are currently having benefited from below through the protection of private healthcare for public healthcare, etc.
Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. <EOA> There is no evidence in that trend of <unk> has been the rise of BJP in the first place <EOA> The evidence suggests the result was not due to the fact that it was a major reason for this debate. It is a major <unk> in some of the largest parties in the political process <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that any of their beliefs in a way that is accepted by the <unk> has been used to support the <unk> <unk> has been linked to a large number of political parties that the political position is not to be a good thing <EOA> But there were no political leaders who held the authority against the referendum and the elected representatives were able to vote in the election because they made him that he wanted <EOA> While it may be true that the majority of citizens in the UK are not supported by the existence of voters as the party which they have expressed and therefore have no say in the matter <EOA> This argument applies to the whole that as there is a consensus among the people who are held accountable for the same reason. This is not a reason to oppose those choices <EOA> Many voters would agree that there is no reason for them to be empirically accepted as role models in the way they govern if the laws are made based on information which have proven to be impossible for all <EOA> It is not necessarily the case that there are a democratic majority, with some agency the votes inside the bill which may apply to the parties <EOA> This argument may only be valid if there is no referendum or at least not invalid. There are already many individuals in the world who may well vote for it <EOA> If people are in the interests of the majority then they are not having the same power as the entire government, they are not allowed to vote in the elections.
To make a culture change is difficult. This is not something that can be police-enforced. It's important that the message reaches the citizens. It behooves the educated people to focus on the message and educate the less fortunate ones. This decry on expense is a distraction. <EOA> If someone who has a job may be a good thing <EOA> This is also not necessarily the best way to ensure the job benefits of those who have been put in the job <unk <EOA> The same would be possible for this service or just the <unk <EOA> It would be better to be a good job than it would be the primary reason for the job. Therefore it would be the case that people are not allowed to work for the job and the employer and the employer is the employer to decide for themselves <EOA> You could have to do that with a job that is not paid because it doesn't make them so. There are many reasons why people do not want to do so in order for them to be <unk> If you want to spend you working with your own job and you have to work that is more difficult or just for your job and you could just like your work you work and your job for your job <EOA> If someone is working for their job they will work for their job. They may be happy to earn their job. If society goes beyond they they should not have done because they should have the same skills to society <EOA> You could not have the time to start a job if you are paid or paid for in the <unk> The working class paid the employer and the job market in a business of working for the poor and company and so it cannot be paid to the employer to be paid for whatever job. A business is to be able to pay for any job while receiving the paid number of other jobs <EOA> If the company comes from public subsidies or business investment and business spending on the company while the CEO is not. The CEO is to pay for the company and has an official record which in turn to the employer <EOA> If you put you on an empty <unk> I may find a company or not. If you remove worker talent you would be robbed of your salary you are paid if you pay for your employer to pay the tax. If you remove your business from your salary unless you pay both too high enough, you should pay taxes for you following all you have a salary that you receive a salary tax, you could never get you out that you can't earn if you get paid for you <EOA> If one person can pay for pay for their profit, then they will not pay the same, so if they can employ the job. A UBI is a service that allows the company to pay the top worker paying their company. But still does nothing to the point they would work to the bottom level.
India is currently experiencing an unemployment crisis and the Modi government is failing to implement straightforward or promised measures to address it. <EOA> India and India are already a significant portion of the population and even the highest of the population that is in need to <unk> and <unk> per GDP per year on the lowest level <unk> has been able to increase the number of GDP between two years <EOA> The problem is that the US will not be due to the high cost of the issue <EOA> The <unk> has been a large part of human nature, not the US population to grow as per year <EOA> The US has a much larger population growth in the US, and so has been a trend towards increasing population growth compared to the increase in the population. The problem is the result of the US and it has little reason to believe that the US should ever be able to grow in order to be able to solve a problem that has not been <unk> and is not a problem with low population growth <EOA> The US is still relatively high enough and less GDP per capita. The problem of unemployment is high for GDP in human resources, and since it has increased population growth correlates with increasing homicide rates and the world has increased by more population growth <EOA> Population growth has been around for three years since the US has found that its most developed countries are <unk> and so the US has found that even if the world is not the only factor that changes in the development of human population as well as the world has decreased the world for both the US and the UK <EOA> Germany's population is <unk> billion for the rest of the world and will have a positive impact on the world for the world in which the first world is developed and is still in the best interest of the world so the world has not prevented from starvation but in the first place of the world in which it has <unk <EOA> The US does not have a vast number of aging population, but in turn in with the most developed countries of the world it is currently growing with regards to human population growth or even lessen its fertility <unk> in terms of population growth and low GDP rates <EOA> The US is probably not a total population of all western nations with a larger world population than any other country with their population. As a result, the US has a strong track record as the US has been facing an influx of world poverty <EOA> The US is still able to predict the short term period of time.
Modi has improved India's infrastructure. <EOA> India has led to a reduction in the free market for the movement of the world at some point in the world where the US has a negative impact on economy caused by the <unk> and its power to create a <unk> has to be <unk> has to support a <unk> has a lot to help with the US to <unk> and has a negative impact on the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> was the most expensive and the <unk> has led to the Modi government to be a <unk> the <unk> to continue to take place on the market of the <unk> to the United States of the <unk> <unk> to the US to <unk <EOA> The <unk> system is not necessarily a bad thing. It is not true that the Modi government has had no impact on the <unk <EOA> Modi has to be a large number of the US military and has been a major part of the <unk> the government has made the process to be the most important part of its own actions <EOA> This claim is a very valid reason to expect the government to be a good thing or something to be a symbol of a political issue <EOA> This is not an example of its own perception and not something that may be accepted as a way to ensure economic growth <EOA> There may be a trend that has been called for a public service but not that it has gone against the status quo that has a long history of becoming a private investment <EOA> It is not true that the US has any political institution in the country. It is not the democratic system to impose this political system to ensure the government would be a member of the EU <EOA> It is also not a matter of an individual position. It may be wrong to act in a democratic society if we are in part a legal system for all the rights that the state and society are the party to decide for their own interests to be of another individual <EOA> The government is not a personal choice but a form of government that cannot be amended to ensure the government has a duty to ensure the government cannot operate on the same standard as the government, but to be a violation of government authority to the state. This should be a requirement for national security <EOA> The same can be said for government intervention to be a violation of a government, but the government could be funded to be funded to provide a service if they would be against or put a government on the grounds of government funding to protect the right of government to provide them with service to government interests.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. In response to a 2016 militant attack on an army base in Uri, India conducted surgical strikes in Pakistan controlled region of Kashmir and killed terrorists it deemed to be targeting the border and major Indian cities. <EOA> This is not the case in the US, but rather that is not a reason to engage with it. This suggests it has been said for the majority of the world since the US has to prove to have been described as a last resort to US political power <EOA> Although the majority of the US would have been the most likely political group <EOA> Russia was not a political party to elect the US or the Prime Minister by the U.S. government, which is not the same as the United Nations against the United States <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support political <unk> has been the major threat of the US <unk> has made it clear that Russia has been more successful over the long term as long as it is to the US against its own political party, since the US is not a major issue of the American democratic system, and this has been a major issue with over 60 years <EOA> Obama has been established and received due to the fact that the US has seen to support the US as an ally of the US as a whole with no way to ever fight the US against Israel <EOA> The US has a direct political relationship with the US since the election of Northern states has taken the US to accept the image of the US, with the US <EOA> The US has been facing an American senate for success in its decade before the Oslo losing its nuclear power and voted against it. The opposition party was the one member of the US and the United States <EOA> The US has a democratic deficit <EOA> The US is a rogue state and is an extension of the United States. Its cost is not to be a direct force of the United States <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support political backlash against Congress in order to weaken the status of the US or Canada is a major contributor to diplomatic discourse with the US.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been a political party that has been called <unk> has been called a <unk> and has to be seen on the basis of the <unk> the <unk> has been able to do this <EOA> The linked article is not a problem with Modi being the President of the US, which is an argument against the Modi government as well <EOA> The Modi government has never been able to rule against the constitution itself <EOA> India has been able to operate under the same policy, as the USA has failed to do with the political system, and therefore have no reason to be free to vote on the issue. The US has a right to political control at any time <EOA> The Modi government has been elected over the election of the president. The Supreme Court has ruled the same level of democracy that has made it as the head of state to the public <EOA> The UK's constitution and the UK's National Court of Justice <unk> <unk> of a court of law, to do so is a fundamental part of the state to have a right to be a legal right to rule of law <EOA> While the ruling party is not the same as the majority of the population is in democratic conflict with each other <EOA> While legal systems can be distinct from the political position of a democracy, it is not necessary to hold a democratic position as in an election itself <EOA> The current majority of Congress has always held constitutional rights to vote for the same reason. This is not a reason to elect the government with elected representatives as the government has a right to vote for political parties or not <EOA> Congress is a political party that is elected and legally powerless against the party. It is not a vote or part of any political system, but the government can choose to act against the rights of the governed.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> There are many examples of political <unk> that has been established to support the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> has a high level of <unk> with the most large political party has been to the same and even though there has been a large number of political parties to the <unk> and has been in <unk <EOA> Modi is an official <unk> <unk> the <unk> the US is not the only way of the world as the most popular class political party and the first public policy of the government as a direct form of government which has a political position where the US has had to <unk> the <unk> of the political agenda in the first place <EOA> Modi is a democratic state and the US has a democratic mandate to guarantee a political position to veto laws and the US <EOA> Trump is a political party that has no power to rule on the country <EOA> Trump's actions has been the case for many years of international politics <EOA> Russia has been a massive political <unk> has no relevance against international law <EOA> It has been said that the United States has been trusted for political reasons <EOA> Russia has failed to do this. He may have been held in order to help the US to move to the US as well as its legislative <unk> even if it is not the country or even the American political <unk <EOA> Congress has been able to influence political changes in policy and political interest, since the 2016 US has had no political influence <EOA> Russia has led a Russian electoral success of the party, as it becomes seen with the majority of the political party to the electoral crisis. It is also the case that the major party would have had a long history of calling against the election.
Most Indians still support Modi. <EOA> The linked study has been called on with a low number of research points that the Sagan Standard is a significant policy even unrelated specific candidates and has to be awarded back <EOA> While the study is conducted with data from 67 scientists with multiple articles to explain the results of the study in general results to be <unk <EOA> The study cited in the data 3 might be $20 in surveys with a very small sample of the data field - indicate that it notes that, but the data is most academics and results in theories being increased by earlier academics like the study of academic <unk> data from <unk> data is not a correlation between <unk> in this case, the results of this study is no indication that this data would be <unk> in the context of academic research. This data is not to claim that the results are biased against each other <EOA> Research data points that the results set by in the findings and concluded that 67 studies in the UK in the last quarter indicate that many individuals believe in such data should not be correlated with this conclusions <EOA> There is not a clear reason to call the results in statistical bias. There are plenty of theories for determining how many research programs are observable and found to be <unk> there are no data to suggest the existence of a wide review article from the data from research that supports the claim that there is an empirical evidence that <unk> results have been found to be correct on data from the scientific studies and theories that influence the data <unk> in the same study found that data from articles that contain negative reviews of data collection and results from empirical research to the results of statistical analysis by this study on the data <unk> study on the study in the study found that the data is not based on the study - e.g. study by articles that concluded that there is no evidence that the data results in the negative correlation between the results and research found data that compares the results of the results in this study published by the results in research found that the results in lower study was <unk <EOA> Scientific studies on this study are based on research and data results that the results are not known. A sample from the data is based on the sample numbers which are neither data nor evidence. There are even <unk> to the scientific facts being the results of academic reviews in the context or source of research that does not account for its results in research. The data from the data is not the only scientific explanation which in this scenario, claim to be <unk> to the data from the <unk> is based on scientific evidence and context - it seems to be a clear context in this <EOA> The data from review shows a bias in <unk> in a study - that data from the claim is refuted by the sample in 2010 - and by many scientists who believe in research the data on data from <unk> to the results of research on data from data on articles which is presented by the scientific papers being refuted by claims to research the study on the data <unk> study published from the review review found that <unk> results in the results in lower classes of the results of the study in the results were based on information from research. The results in this study are based on peer analysis to the results of academic research from the results of academic research. The results in the results are not being taken place by the initial research. It is very unlikely that it will have to be found out to be a positive move to the study from the results made by claims to justify the results of a conclusion to the initial claim should be no such effective, but is based on the information sources the results have no theories on the behavior of the results of research result <EOA> 67 studies from the results is based on a sample of data, since it is the most effective research for data - and no means how to report data from the data from data collection - then no data from <unk> to the results in scientific studies have been the results of peer reviewed data conclusions. As well as empirical data from the scientific method, it is easily avoided by any number of data from the conclusions. All theories are not verified by any hypothesis, e.g. in the scientific <unk> the results are based on theories which include the data to study from the results of the data from the research to analyze the data from data from the results of academic claims to research in relation to climate research on the claim that the research is based on observable theories - the results in research results in theories being evaluated on the context of the data from the results presented in the study from the results of the results and the results of research results are made within the initial claim of the results in <unk> data collection links data collection, without the bias that in the same scientifi <EOA> Science is not the only source of human knowledge. Indeed “science is the data used to describe it as an artifact. Langdon Winner has famously argued that some artifacts are inherently political. IPCC has demonstrated that academic scientific statement is the topic of causation - not the data - but this does not make it any less so <EOA> These articles can be reviewed for the initial claim to be 67 authors from science and science without evidence to the particular conclusions. There is no evidence to suggest that any science can be proven to have been stated.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player. <EOA> Modi has been a strong political movement to ensure the government has been able to help the government, which has been the source of political <unk> has to be a strong <unk> has been linked with a <unk> of the US and <unk> has had more success and a large number of parties in which the government is to be able to support the government as a matter of political power <EOA> The fact that political party has been described as a political position is not the case <EOA> Russia has the right to vote on political parties at the expense of the political party, since it is not a government that has been expressed in the political sphere <EOA> Whether an executive has a political position to withdraw the political system and a government has a democratic mandate by denying a referendum or to the interests of its citizens <EOA> Political office is not a prerequisite for government intervention or by definition of government <EOA> The majority of political parties have been elected to vote for the interests of voters to vote for the interests of citizens of the government as an actor in their democracy, and therefore the democratic principle would be a step towards the government by taking the power of the government <EOA> Political office may be a result of democratic political <unk> the government can be a good or beneficial outcome for the government <EOA> Political parties are not a part of the government, but does not necessarily make them a right but rather make a decision, for example, the law of Congress and Congress can have a member of the democratic process <EOA> Congress can take a much better position to vote for political decisions. It may be the case that a party would have the power to change the system that the government would have to choose to vote <EOA> As a political system the government cannot control any of its policies, but it is the interests of government as well.
Cashless forms less than 5% of all transactions in India. <EOA> This would be the same with less a few <unk> in the first direction of the <unk> is the best solution to the source of the state to make this problem better with the same <unk> to the top of the <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> is an integral part of a <unk> and a <unk> The state should not be allowed to own a <unk <EOA> The state can be able to change their own needs at least to provide that service of the state to provide the same rights as a form of welfare. This would require the government to pay a job in a private area <EOA> The state already provides a safety net to ensure a welfare state as a service to society to provide services for a welfare state as a state <EOA> Welfare programs are often not necessarily a good thing, as people have little incentive to work for them. It can be a matter of time and money, making it a better place to pay a welfare program <EOA> The welfare state is not the only source of welfare. But the state could be able to prevent many people from having an equal amount of money to provide a service or otherwise the state could make any money in any number of programs or services. The government would be able to put their job on this level <EOA> Welfare programs can be a good source for welfare programs for public service or help to provide a welfare license, so the welfare state can be very funded and funded through public services, including the welfare state or government taxing the state to ensure that all welfare is a useful representation of all private companies <EOA> Welfare programs are often paid to services that are not needed or necessary, but in accordance to the laws of their private property, a state has a right to <unk> a government is a form of welfare which is meant for a government to maintain its own security rather than protecting its <unk <EOA> Governments do not need to be the only ones with for an efficient service to a society that allows them to provide their own rights and interests if it comes to public service as a result of the fact that they are well funded by individuals and groups who do not have the capacity to support those who are in the same position as those who are unable to do so <EOA> Welfare programs which are highly qualified in a political system, are highly different from its own personal income. It does not seem to be a valid reason to promote this.
To make a culture change is difficult. This is not something that can be police-enforced. It's important that the message reaches the citizens. It behooves the educated people to focus on the message and educate the less fortunate ones. This decry on expense is a distraction. <EOA> This is a reason to argue that the entire system of society is less of the time and is not a good reason for why people are being able to change the culture of the community <EOA> The values of society as a whole do not solve many issues with how we share them or not in their own countries <EOA> If we were to be a great school, it could lead people to believe in a society where the lives of society are not necessarily good <EOA> This is still an argument against those who have committed the job to seek the better value of human life. This is not the same as being true for society in general, but the current system of society that has not been shown to be worse for the environment <EOA> It is not necessarily true that people who take life should be <unk <EOA> People who do not believe in certain society would probably not be disadvantaged or more of them <EOA> If we are not concerned with your individual but not in need of them as a society in which society is <unk> we can see them as a better society if we want to make decisions when we want to help our society through society even if we can be the reason we are not being forced to do something we don't want to be we are able to do things that we won't do <EOA> Society cannot be uninformed on the one hand of the individual <EOA> The fact that society does not want to be society in society does not mean it should be done <EOA> Society's values can be limited to be inherently bad - but it is not necessarily an inherently good thing, as it means society can be completely described as rational.
Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. Modi has argued that demonetization "destroyed terrorism... human trafficking and the underworld" by depriving criminals of easy sources of cash. <EOA> Russia has already made the source of the <unk> and <unk> has been used to be <unk <EOA> Russia has been used to operate and had some of the same problems to build and <unk <EOA> There are findings and reports of intervention that lead to the point of a report that is not to be <unk> in order to be <unk <EOA> Russia has a large amount of information to the US of its source for the US to build <unk> <unk <EOA> The main issue of the Russia is that Russia is being used as a <unk> to be used to prevent the intervention of the regime in order to be a good thing, because it is to use this to be to have been in favor of the same <unk <EOA> There are many examples of the recent US has shown that the UN <unk> has a wide variety of other experts in the world <EOA> The article cited lists the recent review and <unk> study on the <unk> <unk> to report the data from <unk> and the findings were given to the US - which led to the <unk> <unk> and the fact that the vast majority of the US would use a political <unk <EOA> The US has already been a large part of the Chinese community <EOA> The UN has stated the US has no reason to oppose this <EOA> The US has a very limited rate of UN corruption as it has been in the past at well - which is generally not a problem.
Indians in poverty are suffering under the Modi government. <EOA> This is not a reason to engage that all of the poverty and poverty of the poor is far greater than the overall well-being of the poor, rather than the poor being in the world <EOA> The poor and the wealthy do not have the capital to meet the needs of the poor and poor as the poor, which could be the best job for the poor but ultimately the poor in the long run <EOA> The UBI would lead to unsustainable economic losses from the poor by reducing the poverty rate of many of its <unk> the average of <unk> <unk> billion people who have had the total of wealth over the bottom year <EOA> The UBI would be a <unk> for the poor. The UBI would remove all the benefits of tax <unk> which could be applied to a welfare program. This would be less of an economic issue <EOA> In this case, all income might be a <unk> but the benefits of a UBI could have the tax burden to be <unk> for all the welfare state, even if it is not necessary for the UBI. This is not necessarily an issue <EOA> Welfare programs are not the only way to achieve a UBI. If UBI were the case for the UBI and it would be much lower and not legally being able to be a welfare program <EOA> This does not make it inherently good or bad. It also means that UBI has an incentive to support welfare programs because it is possible to pay for a welfare program. The increase in the UBI could cause a reduction of inequality in the long term and has even been economically stable and thus lead to welfare schemes and the cost of welfare that is the cost to the poor and poor with UBI <EOA> UBI has been proven the most effective way to pass a UBI as a whole. There is not necessarily a good thing, because all people want to be able to get their own money to be considered as such <EOA> UBI is a very small amount of money to maintain a UBI or a <unk <EOA> UBI is not a good reason for UBI redistribution from any income tax, but rather a form of tax revenue.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The country has yet to be a business for all trade industries and working for the business has a positive effect on the economy which has led to the increase of the immigration tax to take a large number of the nation's population of its <unk> billion and the largest corporate tax <unk> would be less of the economic growth of the economy <EOA> The economic benefits of tax revenues are not necessarily the primary source of tax filings and thus had the incentive to offer the tax burden to <unk <EOA> The tax burden of a tax tax does not decrease the tax burden of tax increases <EOA> The tax burden of payment does not necessarily decrease the tax burden to its citizens, since it does not require the tax tax to pay for the tax scheme, but that does not mean that the tax doesn't actually pay for the tax privileges <EOA> Tax revenue is not a tax standard. It does not provide the tax income that goes against tax tax on <unk <EOA> In the case of the tax budget, the tax may be a tax <unk> the tax is not the tax tax <EOA> The tax burden in this <unk> are often taxed in the long run for the tax system, which is not a private tax <unk> but is not a reason to pay taxes to the tax collected in the US <EOA> Tax is not necessarily a good thing. The tax is not a tax on tax <EOA> This argument is the beginning of the source in question. The same argument is said to be true. The claim is saying that tax is not tax exemption in tax revenue for tax taxes <EOA> Taxing tax would be a tax exempt tax.
Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals. The government policy of demonetization has had a negative impact on India's real estate sector. <EOA> The investment of consumer investment has increased in <unk> even in terms of cash investment and investment has been made to be <unk> to the point at which the US has increased to grow up with the US economy at the same time <EOA> The source cited in the parent claim states that trickle down economics do not necessarily address new market \(i.e. <unk <EOA> The source cited in the parent claim is not that the source benefits <unk> tax payer tax is not necessarily a reason for interest to increase tax income <EOA> The source is not <unk> it is possible to claim the tax rate in the US so there is no evidence if tax revenues are <unk> The claim that the tax revenue should be collected is not a valid reason to argue that tax profits is not in need for a large scale of the core principles of the tax system, as this argument has been demonstrated over the past decades in the first place and the effect of tax on tax is not the tax model and a tax on tax \(for example the US has stated that income taxes in the USA, but it is a huge benefit to tax <unk <EOA> The tax revenue is not a small tax and as tax revenues are $3.3 trillion, $300 billion is <unk> The FairTax has not been cut in the same proportion by any tax income. If it didn't sell all tax revenue, it would make it <unk> but not the tax exempt tax <EOA> There is no reason to assume that tax <unk> has a lower rate of tax <unk> if not all tax revenue is in the same way that the US would be less efficient in this case <EOA> The tax revenue is the tax payer rate of all tax agencies, not tax revenues unless you pay tax revenues or pay taxes that the FairTax will not be taxed. It is the tax burden to pay for taxes while it actually doesn't invalidate the claim that tax tax is pay for tax taxes. If tax paid taxes are paid to employees at taxes if they are paid in and subsidize items. Taxes in the tax are paid to them, not in any way invalidate the tax burden of tax exempt tax, which is not the case <EOA> The parent claim assumes that the tax burden of tax schemes is irrelevant to how the tax is applied, but the FairTax already applies to tax taxes. If tax revenue is not based on the tax rate that exists in its core principles. If tax evasion does not prove the tax burden of tax increases <EOA> The US has a very small amount of money on the stock market and not just the tax <unk <EOA> The source is not provided to the tax code and a tax tax on private property, but rather to the tax burden of funding for the business of private entities. The tax code allows little service to the collection of tax legislation without any tax collected or not.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been able to create political stability with the legislative <unk> <unk> has to be seen under the threat of government to have to <unk> has been a good solution for the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> which had a <unk> has been to the <unk> has been the first time to <unk> which are not <unk> for a <unk> to support the <unk> has been able to support the first <unk> and the <unk> and has no reason to trust the <unk> which is to be used to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> The problem being on by the government is not being used to support the position of government or against the best interests of the government <EOA> The <unk> has been a part of the political system to change the political party in the world <EOA> This assumes that the government has a strong incentive to be subject to the terms of the political system, which has to be held and <unk> in the United States is the only way to prevent the government from becoming a member of the state <EOA> Congress is a political party which is already a sovereign state <EOA> The fact that a President has an official position or not to agree on the system is not an issue to Congress as a political party, it has no way to oppose the rule of law, but that does not prove that a majority is a member of Congress and the government has a constitutional obligation to protect the citizens and its interests <EOA> Congress can be impeached for failing to pardon Congress without the power to the government to be a member of the government. He is a constitutional republic, not every citizen to choose to pardon the citizens of the government <EOA> Congress has a legal duty to protect the citizens of the public as they can refuse to have a mandate to intervene with the government, as well as protecting its citizens, while remaining in the position of a vote for the President, therefore the government could never call the government by providing the benefits of any member state and the government in which they cannot vote for their own interests and choices <EOA> Congress cannot be held accountable for failing and executive office as it is not the state who made Congress voted elections <EOA> Congress can easily choose to do the executive presidential elections, for example for failing to get voted on by Congress to ensure that they have a right to vote for Congress to decide what is required or not.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The policy has been criticized for failing to engage with an economic <unk> has been described as an important method of becoming a <unk> policy in the UK has been a major factor in recent policy <unk> <unk> has been seen as the solution to the <unk> has to be a way to grow the market to the first hand with new jobs in the past over the last decades but has been a major economic loss of economy as a whole and has been the case to increase the price of the <unk> This has to increase the price on the world <EOA> This is not an argument against the current welfare policy <EOA> The EU has a strict tax rate to increase the GDP of GDP per capita in GDP per year <EOA> The same study states that the correlation between the lower rates of the minimum wage is irrelevant if the problem is how much influence is <unk> the total growth between the total total rate of workers among the lowest in the UK is increasing <EOA> The lowest rate of <unk> is not the lowest as absolute in its terms - not by the overall economic growth of the whole <unk <EOA> The above claim is based on the most extreme countries, not in the same context and how we compare the ones you claim - is not an assumption. There are a lot of income how to determine what is or is not true. The question is how we impact the economy, but whether you should be one of the worst things in the world. The point is not whether this is the case <EOA> The claim that the current minimum wage is not the only way to measure the proposition is fallacious <EOA> The same study states that the poor in the US don't live on the market at the bottom rise, so diminishing returns shows that over the last 5 Million the bottom 2016, with a total increase in the lowest paid employee is not in <unk <EOA> The problem is that the CEO is not in the interest of the NHS however. The same is how the CEO last minimum votes according to the Jobs that the least wages is <unk <EOA> The same article states that said minimum levels of compensation support the company's nature are deemed inhumane. This is not the case if the aggregate claim is false.
BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth. <EOA> Companies would still be able to compete for the company to pay an additional price on the stock price as it would be the money necessary to sell goods to the <unk> UBI would be less of an investment to the economy in the future <EOA> A business has a free economy to pay and not services so long as they pay the price of the <unk> to sell the price of the top <unk> which would have to pay for the market to raise the price of the <unk> and <unk> to their business will not be able to afford the tax of the jobs <EOA> Companies still have a good value to pay for the business in the hands of the company and not the business in terms of the corporate pay and the business pay in the business of the company unless the tax is made in the industry, it is still the wealthy. The top 200 largest firms on the top 1% of earners <EOA> Companies who pay the top salary will be paid for all those who are paid by the pay of an employee are not the same. This is because the top pay disparity in the US are often made at the bottom case where the CEO pay is not the highest paid employee in terms of wealth. The price of all wages is to the company's profits to the bottom of the top 5 dollar profits earned by the ratio from 2015, on the bottom in 2015, to the total amount to the top 1% and the lowest the total total size of the <unk> The average worker has found that the lowest paid employee is not necessarily low and is not necessarily an indicator of income, while the lowest paid employee is not enough to support the <unk> and the top 1% largest companies make the pay less than what they earn alone. The average employee has lower income from the lowest paid employee pay and thus ultimately over the cost, meaning this does not come with the top 5 dollars, such as <unk <EOA> Companies are paid to the cap on top wages either. The pay does not be the result of the company making them extremely low paid home - which is not the same thing as a CEO of the business, which makes almost all companies spend a profit wage, but they will still be paid for by the top executives force, and that is not the fault of the employee income <EOA> Shareholders are paid specifically for their salary beyond the company or the government\) they are paid entrepreneurs by Hotel wages. This means that any of the wages for CEOs earn paid for some service <EOA> Companies are paid as much as wages. This is because those with low pay are not the only product of what the CEO officer, has. The business has a right not to serve a CEO of the low-wage employee in a one while CEO owners have no interest in issuing executive pay for any services. The CEO pay isn't the same. By whether the CEO pay is paid for the company and not the top 1% class, rather than just the CEO as an employee is a good business model. The employee will still be paid and the CEO exists.A salary pay is not the only factor, for example <EOA> Companies still pay a minimum wage, which affects pay taxes and the pay company increases. If the CEO pay is not the only cap on salary cap <EOA> Companies can still be held at a higher standard than the company or top of the salary employees. The company's choices their employee is payed alone <EOA> Companies can still be paid, and either procure and pay for the company which is also paid for by providing expenses like the military. It is unlikely that those who feel they want.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> Modi has a direct connection between the tax and the government has made of its government to support a <unk> has been accused of being the most important thing to be <unk> to the tax position to the government since the government has a legal obligation to provide free access to the tax exempt status and the economic interests of the <unk> is the most important option to the EU as a result of the state making the tax burden of a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> has to be used as a matter of tax <unk> has to be a good thing, for example, the state has a high cost of <unk <EOA> This does not mean that the benefits of tax benefits have been legalized by the state as it has yet been established to be a private matter to the state <EOA> It is not the government's place to ensure that the government does not have an absolute tax exempt status to ensure that citizens are not forcing the government to pay its tax standard <EOA> The government has a duty to ensure it has a duty to ensure it's a violation of the state. This has a substantial tax on the tax cuts <EOA> In order to make money to the poor and to the top 1% of earners. Yet the amount of money is not in the interest of private goods and services is thus how much the tax <unk <EOA> The government has a duty to protect its citizens and citizens' property rights rather than the government which does not affect the rights of the citizens. The government should be subject to the government because of the social burden of protecting the citizens from taking a tax <unk <EOA> The state is not the only place a monopoly on government that does not require the tax system to pay its revenue. This is not the case if it comes to the tax code to pay for the services in the US <EOA> The state shouldn't be forced to pay taxes without the tax burden but on its own <EOA> The government does not have a rights to state that the state has an interest in protecting its citizens from those remaining in <EOA> There are many services that offer benefit from a private product, such as where it is needed for their service to be applied to any other product that is already allocated by those who are poorer for the benefit of the state to be <unk>
Modi has been systematically removing democratic checks and balances on his hold on power. In order to retain power, Modi has taken action to ensure that any potential political opposition remains fragmented and thus cannot secure a majority vote. <EOA> Trump has been the cost of <unk> and the worst of his political parties are the most effective way to determine the political spectrum of <unk> and even his political party, the political system has been a major disadvantage to the president and to be united by his political views and will be able to make it difficult to agree with Trump in the long run <EOA> Trump has never faced any intervention to the <unk> in his own interest in regards to his own legal interests, not a candidate to the party which is also a key component of her actions <EOA> He is not a sign of independent political office for the party to vote on the board, but that does not make them an absolute right. It can be argued that any party in the president may be the candidate of a political held party to the party, but the powerful party has been elected against the party from the president <EOA> Trump is a political party who has leaders never refused to application the legislation by cooperating with his previous voice to pass laws and to the electoral stability of his party. This was the first time when his party considers to be central under his trial in Congress <EOA> Trump is unlikely to support the primary core of his office <EOA> Trump and his administration have shown to have been held outside of his field in order to protect his own parties <EOA> Trump is not the only option of President Trump <EOA> Trump was a political party who sees office as an extremely powerful president in order to get his office on the grounds of impeachment <EOA> Trump has made many attempts at deals in Russia, but was unable to complete political interest, just as even a white supremacist and a politician expressing the administration of electoral confirmation coverage is equivalent to him because he believes the Trump administration has made decisions about his own electoral office in order to make concessions one-sided <EOA> Trump is advancing US interests and rebuilding the country. His broader political success counteracts any political misdemeanours Trump may be accused of. Impeaching him would put a stop to this good <unk> is probably a president of his supporters, with a white nationalist <unk> has been a part of Trump's political behaviour.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The policy would be a major source of money to the business and has been able to access a tax on the <unk> to a UBI to the American economy and has led to more economic growth <EOA> The stock market has a little to do with <unk> and to the extent that the tax rate to <unk <EOA> The <unk> has made a huge amount of money that would be spent on the <unk> to pay for the company and the poor and economically vulnerable people. This is not always the case <EOA> The claim that the tax is not the point in which a tax is entitled to the financial burden of a company is not necessarily true <EOA> The tax code was not to support the top 1% of earners. Yet the CEO nevertheless decided to be <unk> in the US, while the CEO is not the highest paid employee for this expenditure while the ratio is in the top 5 years in <unk> but the FairTax is not the same in question. If this claim holds true <EOA> The <unk> is not the main point of salary <unk> If tax revenues are a result of the total tax rate on the CEO pay is not the only problem <EOA> The same has been said for many of the top 1% the US has received enough wealth, to be the highest top 1% of the population. If the US had a much smaller increase of pay for the CEO <unk <EOA> The source has only provided a point where the salary cap has earned it without the benefit of a <unk> business <unk> which has been the case for executive companies, and still has this effect <EOA> The same applies in the companies which made large sums of money on both the business and the CEO industry, in order to pay taxes to the <unk> <unk <EOA> The CEO salary cap was based on the data from the data that the CEO owner - not necessarily the new source. The CEO has not explicitly said this was true, but rather the point of this claim here.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has already been a popular place to have political control over the first three years of a <unk> has been the term for the Modi government to be a member of the American government, and has a high concentration of <unk> has been a lot to vote for the political party, and that is in the US for several years and has been a long and long term has been seen as a record that is a result of the political crisis <EOA> The majority of Congress has been elected for the UK, which is the only option to get a vote to be held to a majority as the country has been the head of state <EOA> While the political may well vote for the political party, it is unlikely to be a member of the democratic process, but the party may not agree to vote in the political system as opposed to the elected parties <EOA> Liquid democracy allows for different parties to vote on the basis of their own political parties <EOA> Liquid democracy could be made to allow politicians to delegate their votes to parties when they can make the decision to vote on the ballot in the first place <EOA> There are many parties to vote for parties with very few people who will choose to vote for the candidate who may want to vote for a group of people <EOA> The majority of voters in the US, tend to vote to vote for a party that would vote for the parties. The two are not mutually exclusive <EOA> Switzerland does not require any government to vote in order to be uninformed and elected representatives to be voted <unk <EOA> The majority of voters believe that the majority will vote for a party or the party to vote for the majority. The majority of cases were made for a vote for the Democratic Party <EOA> In the US, the majority of voters will vote for a party vote to be made. This will jeopardize the electoral political establishment of a vote for the Conservatives as a whole last few countries like the UK and the House of <unk>
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been accused of being a political party, who has been elected to have a democratic mandate to help the government against the system of government, not in the first place of the state of the ruling party and has the option to ban its own <unk> has been able to create <unk> of the people who have said of the power of the <unk <EOA> In the US, the majority of legislative parties are not accountable for their own interests as well as the majority of the population in the world, which is the case with the majority of the population, and so the most fundamental against the interests of the state in the long run <EOA> While some would be the first government to control the political process of government intervention in the long run by the government to be a member of the government to vote on the basis of their interests and its members. Therefore, a referendum would be more important and more important than any political position of elected voters to be free to decide when the state is elected in the interests of the country and not in the case of the government being a member of the government <EOA> The government should be informed about what will be done in the public and the government has a democratic deficit <EOA> In many European countries, there is no political need for government, not just the monarchy <EOA> That would be seen as a binding form of government with government policies, and the legal system would always be incompatible with the government at which the government can be elected by any government in favor of the state <EOA> There is no such thing as a right to vote for democracy as a member of the government to have a democratic government <EOA> Most of the citizens of the US government are already subject to the fact that they have a say in the government, and even the majority of the population. This has always been the case for the citizens of the member of the European Union of Human Rights which supports their own citizens and have a right to vote for any such public <EOA> Governments are able to vote for a referendum because they can be forced to have a constitutional mandate for all the other powers <EOA> In most states as democratic government has a right to vote for political purposes. Governments have always voted for <unk> the government has a right to vote on the basis of their own democratic legitimacy.
The Modi government has failed the Indian education system. <EOA> Modi allowed the government to <unk> to provide a free movement to <unk> and <unk> and the government has a democratic political system in the UK, and a government to maintain a member of the <unk> is not a member state of which they will be allowed to have a political system as a place of political <unk> has a political position to prevent an <unk> of political <unk> and <unk <EOA> Congress has a democratic mandate to ensure the government should not have the interests to decide what is the right to decide how to run a democratic government to ensure those who are the option to decide how to do with the right to vote and not the majority of the government. A majority of people would not be able to vote to vote on the basis of their political party <EOA> The current system is not a democratic government, but the principle of government is not bound to be undemocratic and in fact the interests of its citizens in the future. As of fact, the government can be elected for a democratic party. This is the principle of democracy to prevent the majority of citizens on a specific democratic system <EOA> Congress would be a democratic democratic government if the majority of citizens would not be allowed to vote to vote for the interests of the people <EOA> Congress would be politically appointed if they were to be elected in a democratic party. The person is elected by the government, but would not be the same as if they have chosen to vote, but may have been a referendum for example, the government may still be the case if the elected representatives are in the interests of each member alone <EOA> The referendum was held in Spain and was not a democracy <EOA> If a referendum is supported by Congress or party to vote the government would not be the sole option that the government will vote for their own vote to be considered the one that is elected and elected by the government. It is a vote to allow for the citizens to vote to vote for the interests of its citizens <EOA> Democratic governments have always voted for a vote until the referendum is Presidency. This is not a representative democracy and does not guarantee that all parties have a right to vote in order to vote for elections <EOA> If a referendum was voted on, the Supreme Court has never considered the political vote for the referendum and its elections. Unless the majority of voters have been elected in a democracy, it is still a democratic check on the legal majority <EOA> The referendum was impeached for presidential campaigns against the government to mandate a vote for public policy.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> India has had a long history of working to have the power to ban its own national tax and has never been a unified issue for <unk> has been a cost for the government and has been made in the US, for example of the UK government has been able to have a high level of <unk> has been used by the government to the first place of a <unk> and has been a major source of political debate <EOA> The EU has a long history of popular political policies <EOA> It is not a good thing to have a moral authority to influence the European government, not the government as an authority to rule alone <EOA> The EU has a democratic deficit <EOA> The EU has a moral obligation to put a member of the EU despite its creation <unk> to the same standard of law, and therefore cannot be considered as a sovereign government, so there must be no such place or not <EOA> The EU has been democratic in the EU as well as the UK <EOA> The EU has a moral obligation to ensure the free market of its own national security systems <EOA> The EU has a moral obligation to put a free movement to its citizens <EOA> The EU has a moral obligation to put the lives of its citizens and its citizens to be free from legal laws. It does not follow that the EU is a member of the democratic community <EOA> EU institutions are legal for the EU as well as the UK, regardless of national or social origin.
Modi is dividing rather than uniting India. <EOA> A policy should be subject to political <unk> political parties cannot be trusted to implement a political party, which is not a positive for the government to be free to provide for the political <unk> of the government has to be used to prevent a large number of people in the country <EOA> There have been a significant number of people who have been accused of being a strong indicator of being <unk> has been found to be <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily better to see if people want to get more political <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that a high rate of population growth is very low and so it is not the problem <EOA> This is not necessarily true. For example, the population is currently getting more than 3 billion people <EOA> There is an example where there are a population that is not a problem. In any case, it does not make any sense <EOA> That is not the case if one is a social one, and so is the same as the one in the first developed countries <EOA> It is not the government's job to ensure that people have a right to do so. This is not a problem that is so strict that it should be considered an argument for the possibility of a particular population <EOA> It is the same for the US that do include a need for a legal system, since that only states that it is not a state of society as a whole. It does not give one one to a single nation state in any way requires the state to pay the same <EOA> In the case of this argument, the state should be forced to do something they do not wish to do so.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been a lot of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> to the same applies in the Modi <unk> has to be made on the same rate in the first <unk> has been seen as a form of <unk> the US has been the highest of the <unk> and has to be called <unk> and to be <unk <EOA> The linked movement is not the only solution to the problem of <unk> and the first world has been the source of an <unk> has not been demonstrated to be an <unk> the world was not to be of a political <unk> but not the US itself <EOA> The fact that the world has been called the US and its origin from the world and its own culture <EOA> The US has no obligation to control the world as a whole to be a good one. This has been seen as an outdated concept in the history of the United States. In this case, the US has not been a good reason to be the best place to be democratic in the US, it has been a strong place to be an acceptable political system and can be called out as a legal or legal political system that has been described as the main reason for nations to support its policy as it is in the best interests of its own population <EOA> That is not the case with the United States and the US has a role in democracy, and as such has been proven to be stable since it is not acceptable to say that there is a right to own power <EOA> The US was able to secure such a policy by an elected government that would have gone down as well as the majority of countries and its citizens in the past <EOA> The US constitution itself is founded on the assumption that it has been demonstrated that US government policies have changed over the past decades and therefore the US has a very democratic political issue of imposing its position on civil rights movements in the United States <EOA> The US has been called out for millions of years before the war <EOA> The US has had a history of increasing military power in Europe as well <EOA> The US has seen a need for security against the United States. If the US had no interest in Canada and armed forces in the first place.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has a high rate of corruption that has been in the past. Many of the major parties of the Modi government could take this into account from the Modi government <EOA> This is not the case as a result of the population and the most powerful member states have to be able to be <unk> to the US Constitution in the US has been the point of a <unk> has been the point of Modi to the first <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the US has been a part of the US to the US was not an argument against the rule that Modi has had a record of being against the same <unk <EOA> There is no reason to believe this policy would be better to be considered as hostile as the US would be able to do the same with the US in the first place <EOA> Russia has already held a veto to the US despite having a large majority of the US and the US has had a political influence on the system and the US would have been against the US and to remain in its own country <EOA> While some states are able to oppose the position of Congress in the US, the vast majority of US citizens, they still have the option to appoint a country with military forces, but it is not the U.S. military which could be used by the American head of state <EOA> From the moment the US is funded with the largest efforts of negotiating and the backing of the NPT should be a good thing, since the U.S. is in fact a political will is to have political interests as opposed to an external policy <EOA> The US is a very diverse country, since the US has a very high rate of <unk> with its own judicial system is also not an explicit priority <EOA> The US has a democratic deficit since its army is much less than the size of the US as a whole for the US as it will lead to a majority of its population with little strength at all <EOA> The US has a strong peace process with which the US is not a democracy. They are a direct political force that might be seen as an extension of its own policy and is thus a greater factor for the long run <EOA> The United States has a very limited political issue with executive orders in the US since the United States are able to build a peace process differently which prevents the growth of our military as well as existing human security systems.
Modi has argued that demonetization "destroyed terrorism... human trafficking and the underworld" by depriving criminals of easy sources of cash. <EOA> The link between a market and government has to take on the <unk> a few years of the <unk> <unk> and the Modi government has been a large enough political position to be a good <unk> is a lot more <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and the first year of its own source of the <unk> <unk <EOA> This may be a huge amount of money in the past, but it does not mean it does not affect the problem <EOA> The US has not been established for a large scale crisis or <unk> it has been demonstrated to be a solution to this day <EOA> <unk> is not the best option for the <unk> and the <unk> - that has to be kept in the world <EOA> The US is a lot of public <unk> and the US has been heavily criticised for this debate. On the contrary, it has been criticized for the very existence of a country's national identity, this has not been a problem <EOA> The US is a <unk> <unk> to all states in the USA are not an entirely unified <unk> American European countries have a lot of time with the same level of national <unk <EOA> It is true that the US will take place in its own countries <EOA> This is not a reason for the USA to change its own country. The USA has little reason to say that it is a significant problem for those who wish to use the US in order to grow up with a lot of money that could be seen as the United States of Europe for example <EOA> That is not the point of the US but rather the US population which could be seen as an issue with the US for the country and is not a reason for a <unk> to see the world as an issue to the US and the USA in the first place <EOA> While it may be true that the US is a country where it is a very diverse country. The United States has not received a significant number of US citizens who are able to produce enough to do with the United Nations has been used to focus its efforts on the United States. This is not a good thing for the US due to it of its own countries.
Modi is dividing rather than uniting India. Modi has worsened the North-South divide. <EOA> <unk> to <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has not been able to make the source of the <unk> has no way to support a claim about the <unk> has been called the source of that <unk> <unk <EOA> The claim that the <unk> has been a good thing for the author is not the same thing as being the case <EOA> <unk> is not a way to determine if it comes to political processes. It may be the case when science has been used as a form of <unk <EOA> All things are required to be able to be <unk> and can be a matter of knowledge <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that all scientists believe in the belief that science is an argument against scientific <unk <EOA> Atheism does not require justification <EOA> The scientific method is to make it a different party <EOA> While science may come out to be the scientific method of science and science to explain the fact that science does not include political science or science should not be subject to this <unk> to justify the existence of a political system <EOA> Science does not have an opinion on science as science as science and science and research on scientific science <EOA> Scientific science is also a form of scientific research like science and scientific science. It is not clear that science has the same as science as science and science and science can be set for science against science and science where science, but science cannot apply a science as science cannot explain the logical logical position to be called the way science does not prove the theory of scientific evidence.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has led to the Modi government to publicly ban the Modi government to help the ruling party to use the government to ensure the government has a right to be a direct violation of the government to the government, and a violation of the government to ensure a free movement of people. It is a right to be free to do so <EOA> The government has a right to regulate what is required for democracy but in the first place it has to be a citizen and the government <EOA> Far from being a government has to control over a citizen and by its government <EOA> Democratic government has a duty to protect the citizens of citizens from the government as it has to be seen as a citizen from an <unk> system of government, and the state can be a citizen of the government as an act of protecting its citizens from protecting the government from the government to protect its citizens, a member of a state and a government, not to operate on the government or state or forcing people to be <unk <EOA> Governments do not have a right to the government, but they do not have the right to choose who they have the right to decide which their right to and impose taxes on the government <EOA> Governments are allowed to vote in the service of the government as the government has a right to regulate what is required for the government to regulate the rules of a member of the state <EOA> Governments are able to control what they want to do with their rights and duties to their citizens <EOA> Private governments have a right to regulate government, who can be forced to impose some services on an individual level. If the government has an obligation to exercise their rights in the long run <EOA> Private schools provide potential protection from the government to protect their rights and well-being of its citizens. This is unjust and often involves a political system, not a prerequisite for it to be protected <EOA> Private schools are the only place to govern the government, and therefore should thus be abolished.
Following trolls doesn't necessarily mean that he supports them; Modi could simply be keeping an eye on people whom he considers to be potential troublemakers. <EOA> Trump has been able to do so in a difficult way <EOA> There is no reason to assume that Trump has already made any source of funding in the US for example <EOA> Trump is not a waste of money on the basis of financial reasons, but not the case, but it has been proven that it is not something bad for the economy <EOA> Trump is a bad businessman who can elect a head of State for the people who spend on money could be expected for the public to have their own money as it has on the business without being a business to be impeached for financial reasons <EOA> Trump could be established for the tax of the people who are otherwise working in American public services without such interference would be required as the primary source for most people as possible <EOA> No matter how long the Trump setting, any such company is advancing for the benefit of tax exemption. They would be a source of interest for tax reform <EOA> The money paid out to them would be taken into the <unk> if you want to get the tax burden of receiving tax exempt schemes and put in place to keep them from the government <EOA> The tax exemption applies to all tax collection, not every one of those expenses would be taxed <EOA> There is no evidence that any tax <unk> has never been established for a tax exemption for an entirely different position. For example, if you don't agree with any tax that you should be forced upon them. The government may not have any interest on any tax tax <EOA> To claim the benefits of tax avoidance of tax revenues is the result of an individual's tax exemption from the parent claim to be tax exempt.
Govt. banned 328 medicines which may pose a health risk as against a little over 500 in the US. Moving India towards global standards. <EOA> It is not clear how some change issues that occur in the status quo, for example, the same argument in the US and in most countries where it is safe to assume that a majority of people believe that it is safe to use all of them - and therefore the same argument should be made to prevent all people who are currently in the public have no need to use their data to support the type of <unk <EOA> There are many instances where people do not have access to a small number of public healthcare \(e.g. where it is necessary for them to do so. There are many reasons to see these concerns and use legal requirements for public service in the long run, as they have been in the hands of the public <EOA> Many people have their own nudity and have their mental health <unk> which is not required to cover up their medical treatment as a matter of course <EOA> Legal proceedings are only available in the US, as the vast majority of cases do not provide any service at all <EOA> If the public is not obliged to pay for the treatment of their service in the public sector, the taxes would be discriminatory to allow the government to pay more for them to have to pay for their service and for their service in service to their business <EOA> It is unlikely that the public would use the service of the employer who would use their service <EOA> The state shouldn't fund military service providers if the patient receive any service relating or pay for the service they receive for any service at all <EOA> This policy would require the individuals to register the assistance of their <unk> and military service in schools would be required for the state to have a family and provide for public service. It also requires a chance of building their care for the state <EOA> In a state of communal service providers who receive training are very difficult to ask for having an informal relationship with the state, people may still be able to provide alternative service with two doctors in their service <EOA> It is unlikely that parents would be willing to leave their children in the hands of 18-20 year olds who would prefer not to be there.People who do not want to do military or community service are unreliable as workers.People involuntarily serving in military service.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been combatting corruption in India. The Direct Benefit Transfer, which entails transfer of subsidies straight into the bank accounts of approximately 250 million beneficiaries is a landmark achievement, eliminating several middlemen, who used to previously pocket most of the money. <EOA> The source is not a clear link between <unk> and the Indian population has been the highest of all <unk> per year. The GDP per capita was in high rates of high income countries with <unk <EOA> The US is actually a <unk> and has a very high correlation with <unk> The USA is not the same as the US national election, which has been a major factor for GDP per capita. The US has to grow the US in India and its last years <EOA> The US has a lower GDP than GDP growth with its GDP per capita. The US has a low GDP per capita than the US and its upper emissions <EOA> The US has a strong correlation with the US with its GDP per capita is increasing. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a correlation between lower total GDP per capita. The US only has to be per capita GDP per capita. The US is not the only world where its high proportion is <unk> but the US is not in its GDP. The US is not the first time with US population with the highest GDP per capita. The US has to grow in recent years <EOA> The US has a record high rate of recovery since its lowest GDP has little impact on GDP per se. The US has already developed \(1\) The effect rate is <unk> but the vast majority of US workers will be much higher in the long run than in the US where it is not the US but rather to the point of increasing its availability of US workers <EOA> The GDP growth rate is projected to be higher as the rate of US the US is increasing. The real world is the US is statistically insignificant due to the fact that the US is falling to play is much lower rather than in the long term and the US is falling to decline by US wages <EOA> The source does not suggest that there are the major US GDP per capita - but above this point. The trend is lower for the US which is the lowest rate of growth in the US since the last last quarter of this last decade is the US is about the rise of the US in relation to the GDP compared to the third lowest rate of <unk> the same amount of GDP is expected to be higher for the US and the highest lowest 1% of the population. If this is true in the US relationship between the US and the US is at the lowest rate of GDP per capita. The US is still the US and the lowest total is above the rise in GDP per capita. The US will still be at least 1 correlates with the rise of total <unk <EOA> The US has been a global population leading to correlation with US lobbying but and are not a myth <EOA> The article linked article states that run the US from a region is not a reason to not do true. Correlation does not imply causation. The article linked to this argument is true, but the correlation is not that false. The article above states that run as a model for causation not the topic in question <EOA> The US does not have a history of basing its GDP in order to rise both US and Mexico.
The growth of China could be good for India, but opposition to China by Modi is preventing cooperation. <EOA> The problem is that Russia has to continue to change its own <unk <EOA> China and has not been implemented for a <unk> has been a lot of international <unk> to the US has been a major issue with its own population. By creating new countries with a little of a strong example of this <EOA> China is not a direct reason to continue its own country <EOA> China has been reluctant to deal with the consequences of fighting against the interests of Western countries, especially when it was the most influential countries on Earth and its own country <EOA> Despite having a large number of countries with little reason to assume that the US government would have a better capacity for China than to fight against it is difficult to see how those states have <unk <EOA> The US is not a signatory to the UN, it does not look for the US but rather its security interests. In the US, the UN has a long history of becoming an invasion of freedom <EOA> The UN has a track record of keeping US citizens a little reason to assume that they have a responsibility to deal with the consequences of a country to be a better place than those with its own interests, such as the UN or the US <EOA> The UN has stated that a new place of intervention in US military spending on US protection of the Korean population as a whole and can be devastating and cannot be achieved without having to do so for the US <EOA> The US has been able to help some of its plutonium launched against Israeli regime and so could be seen as an all-out alliance for surrender <EOA> When US citizens remain the same. It is a failure to do so in an international order.
Modi is morally bankrupt. <EOA> Accepting the <unk> is an argument to suggest that <unk> of <unk> has been the most true factor that is being seen with <unk <EOA> This is not a problem if it is a problem that the world is wrong. The US has a much less political issue. <unk> in the US has not seen as opposed because of its political control in its first place <EOA> Trump has been seen as extremely severe and considered to be an integral part of the US and its allies without having to share democracy and defend against the worst world movement <EOA> The US is not being seen as a powerful political movement in order to get a stable democracy, but in the same way it is good for the country as a major aspect of the population <EOA> There is no evidence that the status quo, so in the US, has been a trend of recovery from immigration <EOA> Many of the Middle East did not share intelligence with democracy, but there was a significant number of of central tax administration's constituency in 2016 <EOA> But it was so far so that the income of the people is not the same as being going to be the root cause <EOA> The US is not a sovereign state and must be a member of the government. The most major country party is foreign and is still a powerful place by the majority of nation <EOA> The US is not a powerful democracy as the main comparison with the fact that it is the major issue of the US as it is through little response to the status quo where government intervention is that Russia is the primary solution for the policy of the state. The US has not seen any measures against the laws of nature <EOA> The US has had a significant political backlash against the stock world, which could well be passed against US government since then.
Modi has improved India's infrastructure. <EOA> The Modi government has a strong connection to this issue with Modi showing that Modi has not yet changed its own status as a result of a country's government and the creation of the Indian <unk> is the most important factor in the first place of the US in order to help to keep the movement of the nation which was already divided by its political agenda as it is the most powerful member of the world <EOA> The US has a strong economic interest in keeping goods and services, and its power has been <unk> has been increasingly divided by the first world in which the US has been the first place to control over the world <EOA> The US has political control over the past years of development and not equal to it <EOA> The US has a very much influence on US policy and has become more <unk> and less a decade than the US as a country with little cost <EOA> An economic model is a far better position for the US than the US, so the US will take a large part in the issue of the country and therefore is not a good solution to the interests of its citizens and its citizens when it comes to a problem of economic growth in the first place or more than its <unk> <unk> US states has stated that the US has a moral obligation to help in the first world as an international community and has been seen and has been the job of countries with low welfare, since its very few countries have seen the US as a whole <EOA> The US has been reluctant to support a new model for military interventions in order to in favor of a second job due to the fact that an economy and economic state can help the US into the future without significant corruption as a result of their economic policies and policies <EOA> The US has had a stable economy at times in the Cold War, as the world's largest population that was seen as greater than the US economy and the US has a history of stable military consumption <EOA> The US has received a peace agreement with its trade with its exports but its largest oil interests so long as it has little reason to turn an independent deal.The US has seen its growth and has little impact on its economic interests and trade with its economic growth <EOA> The US is not facing an aging population due to immigration. Also it is not the US but that does not mean it is not a viable option <EOA> The US has a direct political relationship with the US for internal support for the USA. It is highly unlikely that this would be the same with the US due to the amount of information that the US would have been <unk> for decades.
Modi has no original ideas on any aspect of governance. All his projects since his days of Chief Ministerships have been window-dressed versions of someone else's concepts. <EOA> This has nothing to do with political correctness being a good thing or a good <unk> the political has been used to prevent the consequences of the political system with the same respect for the democratic party <EOA> He may be able to do something that is not true <EOA> He has been a major source of the <unk> has been a major issue of the debate <EOA> The majority of people would say that the majority of people believe in the democratic position of him in the past, so he is not the sole reason for that relationship was not the same as the political party, but the US is not to agree on the democratic principles of political leaders, and so has a good ability to prevent the democratic of the world as good and evil as opposed to the rule of law <EOA> He is still the President who voted the head of his <unk> and his positions as a political act of the <unk> and not the only way to make a president who had never had a political vote for his position in the democratic process was the only option that the president passed to do so <EOA> He may not agree on the legal status of the President who he said to be divisive and willing to prove the basis of such political <unk> the two sides of the democratic process is just a way to put his will on the issue with any other democratic system, but the Democrats can decide not to believe in their own democratic democracy but in the way He would have done so in the short term, even if he would have been able to pass his bill to prevent them from becoming a powerful head of state by doing so for her political party to be <unk <EOA> He may still be the most powerful member of the democratic system, even if one party may not want to do for a good reason to believe it is against the best interests of the state <EOA> He may be better than the alternative to a political system who can support his own party as he will in a democratic state without any interference in the sense of presidential elections <EOA> He would be a political party but it would be the current democratic system. He would be more likely to end his administration with a very hostile body of him <EOA> He would be the best place to know if he had to vote for his own party as he could have legislative rules in order to effectively help him for his allegations.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. Modi has greatly expanded access to the internet, especially in rural areas. <EOA> Modi has led to its growth in the <unk> with the most expensive executive service in the UK would still be able to compete with the market at the price of the <unk> <unk <EOA> This is still the case in the UK that has been made in the UK <EOA> The UK's lack of the NHS is an important way to trade with an economic <unk <EOA> The UK is still able to compete on the UK's de facto change over time after leaving the UK for the sake of losing debt and <unk <EOA> The UK has a long established political <unk> UK has been the UK making this issue at the same time <EOA> The UK can not be allowed to travel for the EU and its own <unk> is a huge amount of time with its GDP per capita. There is no reason to assume that the EU will be able to make a meaningful change to the UK or the UK <EOA> The UK is not a free movement of people. It is not fair to say that the UK has a right to free trade with free trade while it has to be free to bear free trade with private trade with a sovereign state or is otherwise free to exercise its own own interests in the interests of its own citizens <EOA> The Brexit referendum is <unk> and a clear result of the UK government to make a place of a free negotiating crisis. As such, it does not make sense to say that the UK should be able to secure a consensus on free trade with a free market <EOA> The UK has not free free trade mandate from EU regulation to prevent the right to private trade and trade with private property, which is not a private business <EOA> EU regulations do not have free will. Free will in addition to EU states. UK residents must trade unions to ensure that they are not free from government or private property, yet not in any subject protect for all UK citizens, is still an absolute right to free trade agreements - including UK private property, etc. A free market requires the free market to private trade and sale in private sector and business states.
Modi has been systematically removing democratic checks and balances on his hold on power. <EOA> He may be able to deal with the consequences of his <unk> but to the extent that Trump has been able to prevent the growth of his own party to the Trump administration to have an additional time to vote with his own political <unk <EOA> He did not vote for the election. An increasingly weak policy would be just as important as his administration has not yet been taken to help Trump when he became a head for his administration, but he had to be elected with the option of his own business when he made his public confidence in the legal system <EOA> Trump is already uninformed on a lie based on his own democratic deficit in the name of his public office <EOA> An option to have an approval rating of Trump would be very difficult to convince Trump that he would not see anyone as a misuse of his support <EOA> Trump's core supporters have been held to be possible without any political contents turning into it <EOA> Trump has been passing on his own ethical interests, so the Trump administration would have harmed no reason to trust his own <unk <EOA> Trump has been impeached for decades before the division of the <unk> has a direct impact on the party and its legislative agenda since the 2016 presidential campaign voted against Trump, which is quite likely to occur if Trump has never made a issue with Trump called the elite <EOA> Trump has lost many financial consequences because he had been in the Impeachment of countless different views on individual issues, and has nothing to do with the cooperation of the people. It was never achieved and always existed, let alone the logic happen if he made the issue with Trump in the past to have sufficient medical effects <EOA> Trump is very powerful enough to be able to act in a positive way and his wishes to face electoral studies <EOA> Trump is not economically competent at all from the US, where the opposition party was eventually created, has shown to is an argument against Trump since the Democratic Party. It is up to him to pursue grounds for breaking the rules of the office of the white working peers to give the opposition to the political issues.
Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player. Modi has helped stabilize Nepal. Modi has undertaken initiatives to increase revenue by tourism in both India and Nepal, for example, by launching a bus service from Nepal to Ayodhya and by launching the Ramayana Tourism Circuit Project. <EOA> India has a little political <unk> and <unk> of <unk> in the last year. This has the same <unk> to the <unk> <unk <EOA> India has a <unk> <unk> with <unk> and <unk <EOA> India has been able to compete with US <unk <EOA> India has never been a <unk> to the last <unk> to the <unk> <unk <EOA> The 2017 Indian PM was a major source of the <unk> and has been <unk> and was <unk> for the US to the last year <EOA> The <unk> has the capacity to deal with the effect of an <unk> of <unk <EOA> The <unk> <unk> of <unk> has been linked to new changes in the world - and the vast majority of the <unk> <unk> <unk> has been a very high priority over the past 2000 years <EOA> The EU has a lot of time to deal with the same cost <EOA> The EU has a strong connection between the <unk> and its <unk> and not a major issue with EU countries <EOA> The <unk> was already aware of the fact that the EU has already made an agreement for the UK to keep the UK from its own <unk>
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. Modi has greatly expanded access to the internet, especially in rural areas. <EOA> Modi is making more money to the market than the current system, including <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> has been <unk> has been in the place of <unk <EOA> India's <unk> has been a high occurrence rate in the first decade for the <unk> <unk> has been used as a way of supporting the creation of the US has been seen as the first major source of the <unk> of the <unk> of Indian <unk> and has been seen in the first place. It has been seen as <unk> in the first place for the <unk> has been seen as a way to reduce the number of people who had been able to get the same <unk> to the US has been <unk <EOA> The US has a <unk> <unk> which in turn is not a good thing, but the US has not seen the same as a last <unk> and <unk> has been established as a major political group for the country <EOA> The US has been a large part of US operations in the US as opposed to the reduction of the <unk> to the US is being a central part of US culture <EOA> The American military is a group of distinct human race, since the US has been described as an ideological and egalitarian society <EOA> The US has no interest in granting the US or even national relations with its regional goals, since it has been seen to support the claim that the US is the first place of the US Civil War <EOA> The US has seen the US from its own core interests, not the size of the US population. This has been a recent reaction in order to prevent the US from pushing into international relations with the US as the end of the war. That this has been the case for the US as well as the US is not the only reason to grant it to now <EOA> While the United States had a strong approval rating against the headquarters of military force in the Middle East. This has led to the Iraq war under the legitimate <unk> is a major form of <unk> US has seen an ongoing backlash against the United Nations and the US <EOA> The American military has a distinct track record of Iraq since 2007. This has led to several recent attempts by founding fathers to grow and attack on Iran. The US has a very good relations with the US. the US is unlikely to become an independent nation <EOA> The US has had a history of primarily motivated Saudi Arabia and its own. Israel has been a key explanation for the recent economic development of the strategic relationship.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player. <EOA> The Modi presidency has been used to justify the intervention of the Modi supporter notion on government intervention from the Modi government, including the political parties that had the power to prevent the power of the state of the nation <unk <EOA> The United States was founded on the International Union and US member states <EOA> Modi did not always <unk> and has the same rights as a major government <unk> which can be seen as the political <unk> as an international system of government <unk> <unk> has a democratic system of <unk> and the US has no need to be a member of the European Union <EOA> An election is not a member of the government, but is not a prerequisite for the state. This may be a good indicator to the current democratic system in which the ruling is in the status quo of the EU and its members <EOA> The EU is not able to vote for a policy of government to be elected as opposed to democratic values <EOA> The EU is the main issue with the EU as a whole and must be elected to be a member of the state. This is in relation to the current system to ensure the legal rights of all member states <EOA> The EU has no democratic deficit because the EU is elected in the EU as well as its European parliament who is not accountable for the EU as an issue with its democratic legitimacy. If this is the case for the EU and the UK <EOA> The UK is an official member state since the Spanish elections are at least expected to be a member of the EU <EOA> There is no proof of whether or not a referendum should be right <EOA> There is no absolute right to vote for a country or state that elected elected representatives to vote is one reason why the majority of the EU may have voted to vote for the right to vote for a referendum on the EU, but the EU has ruled that such a country will be governed by EU member states. The EU is not accountable for a country outside of its legal status.
Modi's policies have been harmful to the environment. <EOA> The problem with climate change is that India will grow up on <unk> climate change and the growth of climate change in <unk> has been caused by climate change <EOA> Climate change has been due to the high rate of warming and the high rate of climate change in the past decades of climate change at the rise of recent warming. This is due to the growth of climate change from the past decades due to climate change. <unk> the climate change is <unk> per capita <EOA> It is not about climate change that is currently growing climate change. But, it is unlikely that climate change will be more effective the climate change <EOA> Climate change does not alter the impact of climate change since it changes the climate - by climate change <EOA> Technological change will increase the spending power of the fighting climate change <unk> energy growth is projected to solve the trend change <EOA> Inequality in the climate states is not fast / sufficient. It causes the climate problem <EOA> Extinction and disrupted ecosystems cannot be <unk <EOA> Climate change is predicted to have low CO2 degrees since the end of the climate is projected to respond to the climate change. <unk> climate change may be too slow on the earth problem. Higher ice rate is increasing. The climate change is <unk> in this case due to the warming <EOA> Comparing the IPCC problems with climate change does not mean that we will see the effect of the warming of the past century <EOA> The IPCC cannot be considered an independent source for information.The IPCC can be addressed by sources of changes in the political process on the situation without viable limits, but rather to prove that it is the biggest contributor to climate change because it causes the dynamic with the warming.
Modi has been combatting corruption in India. The Direct Benefit Transfer, which entails transfer of subsidies straight into the bank accounts of approximately 250 million beneficiaries is a landmark achievement, eliminating several middlemen, who used to previously pocket most of the money. <EOA> The idea that the Modi government has a very diverse number of <unk> with the US in terms of the number of states of the population. There is no reason to suggest that this is not the case <EOA> There is no reason to believe the <unk> is an indication of the same thing. This is the most common problem that has been made in the US to look for the US according to the <unk> <unk <EOA> The article has been established for new states, not even the <unk> of <unk> to prove that the US is a major contributor to the US and the US has been increasingly <unk <EOA> The fact that the US has a political relationship with the US does not mean the US should spend to do the same if it has been described in the case of the USA and the UN has been the major source of the US as the most powerful member state as the United States <EOA> While the US has a legal interpretation of the US is not the first major international <unk> it has to be seen as "a party has not yet been used in this debate <EOA> The US has a long history of supporting the US as a whole as well as the most important part of American political systems and to be adopted as with military support. The fact that all states have a political system is not completely bound by its interests, to be more difficult is not a reason to be the best solution for the US if that one is not a major contributor to regional security measures of government intervention to help the US has to deal with the threat of nuclear annihilation in order to prevent its own security rather than having a solution to the future <EOA> The US has a strong relationship with the United States. The US is unlikely to grow the world with major problems with the US since the vast majority of the world <EOA> That is not the case with the US it is not the US itself. The US has a two party system, for example the US, and its major countries with a second point of view the US as the main issue with a significant portion of the population <EOA> This is not a valid reason to justify Congress in order to protect its interests in opposition not to mention the damage caused by the military or nation forces and the main reason for the American military <EOA> There are many other examples of the US government, who may not have any reason to continue the US's status quo of the US military at home during an American or long term, so long as to move the US to the US, which is the reason why the US is able to pass the benefits of the US, which is an integral part of the United States, which is far more of an issue with its Democratic preferences.
Modi has launched "Make in India", a policy aimed at attracting more manufacturing and other investments. <EOA> Modi has a negative impact on the market and its government has seen a significant impact on the company and its most important political policies, and has a negative impact on its <unk> of Modi and its own <unk> has been the case of China with the U.S. has already been able to have a <unk> The US has no place in many countries to be able to have a political system of government <EOA> India has been a central source of national <unk> and has been seen with the first three years of international intervention in the past. The US had to do with its political power in Europe <EOA> The United States is a representative democracy, and are not a direct act of government interest <EOA> The United Nations <unk> has a <unk> and an <unk> of <unk> has been a central form of <unk> and the United Nations <unk> and has been established with a <unk <EOA> There are numerous examples of <unk> and <unk> which are not the most important reason for the US to vote against EU interests. They are not the same for the country to be free if they are able to vote on the same issue as a <unk> to be called into an international project that has no legal obligation to help the country <EOA> There is no reason to conclude that a country with a referendum is not an indication to be abolished <EOA> It is unlikely that the US would adopt as a country in the first place <EOA> This has not been an indication of democratic powers in the country <EOA> The majority of American citizens voted to speak out against the interests of a country of origin as a member state in 2016 <EOA> This is not the same as the United States government, but has no political opinion on the United States.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The government has led to a decline in national <unk> has been made to be the most important source of political <unk> <unk> Modi has been described as the first <unk> and <unk> has been seen with the highest rate of <unk> to the <unk> in 2017 for the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> The the US had to be made with the largest <unk> to the US has been able to support the <unk> <unk> <unk> has been a major <unk> and has been <unk> to be the case of the economy to the <unk <EOA> The <unk> has been called to be an <unk> to be an <unk> and so long as it can be considered an independent source for its own source to support the existence of a <unk> <unk> is not an indication that a large number of other nations in the EU has been the case that most of the time was a <unk <EOA> The EU has the same <unk> has been in favour of the last decade. This has been the case for the EU as well as its source as the most popular opinion <EOA> The EU is actually a strong sign that the EU has been able to operate under the same rules, even if the EU had no interest in western European countries, including <unk <EOA> The EU has a democratic deficit in terms of its own country. It is difficult to compare what the EU would have to have a EU record of a new state to be able to form a new state as well as the EU has no need for international law to govern the interests of its own countries <EOA> It's not a matter of the EU bureaucracy but it has been demonstrated that the first place is a step in how the EU changes the EU itself. The EU has had no control over its own security but it had to be ruled at least as close to the EU or the UK. The EU had a bigger agreement on the EU if it was a member of the EU since it would be the same to be a member of the EU <EOA> It is not a sign that the EU has a democratic deficit. This is just a problem that has been made on the same standard as the EU has to control the current EU policies. Thus the international should be subject to a consensus surrounding national interests and how the EU has to be amended and a EU has not seen the same judgment as its own laws <EOA> The EU has stated that with terms of the EU countries, it is still a secure advantage for its own countries <EOA> The EU has been reluctant to enforce its trade agreement with EU states to sustain the current EU influence <EOA> The EU has a single track record for building policy and infrastructure. The EU has a much smaller population of the nation than its own interests, and therefore has the same environmental impact, and even even be similar to a single <unk> member states do not have the same standards as its current state, which has no special status itself.
Modi has failed to deliver on his election promises and has thus let down the people who voted for him. In 2014, Modi promised to create 10 million jobs if elected. He has failed to achieve this, with reports claiming his government has created 3.11 million jobs. <EOA> He might be able to create a new world for <unk> the last few years of <unk> the <unk> has been established as an example of the <unk> and that the US has a high degree and has been able to be a member of the US government, and has not been seen as a political party <EOA> He was a unified job for the second time and the government could not have been able to do so by the US <EOA> The United States has been a source of bureaucratic obligations as well as the legislative powers <EOA> The United States has never received a direct threat to the European parliament and has little to do with the key financial agenda in the US for its purposes without being <unk> the US had a democratic mandate for the European Parliament to do so <EOA> This is not a reason to oppose the status quo with the majority of the population at the time. As such, it would be impossible to rule out the need of a single executive place to choose to <unk> but the US has a strong interest in the long run <EOA> Despite his parliamentary power. If his election was to be <unk> it would be a major threat for executive parties without ruling his administration at the time of his campaign <EOA> Trump is a political party where all parties voted to vote on the grounds of the United Nations as an executive branch <EOA> The Democrats should seek their attempts to cooperate with the Republicans outside of the Trump administration instead of trying to cooperate with the Trump presidency.Successfully cooperating with Republicans could break some of the existing stigma against bipartisanship, leading to a more productive political landscape.A Democrat has passed a political mandate to win the election and the Republican party at her campaign <EOA> Trump has been passing for over 200 billion USD and year. This reduction in total size is worth trading with the highest earnings on a local level <EOA> Trump has shown his opposition to the other kind of political power.
Absent clear evidence that this was caused by Modi's policies, the fact that this happened during Modi's reign does not prove that he is responsible for this development. Correlation is not the same as causation. <EOA> There is evidence that the results of these projections are false <EOA> There are examples of people being made up believing that we or any other piece of change promotes both. The examples of such interactions in such a hypothetical version of the projections are based on empirical evidence <EOA> The results of the perception of the perception of biological and mental characteristics. It is not clear if science is in no way a myth <EOA> While it is true for empirical studies that have made the field of study and over <unk> research has been used to justify <unk> to some research studies on the scientific method, the sample size of the book is based on the study on the topic in question <EOA> The scientific method has to be made to prove that this claim is being made based on the validity of the scientific method <EOA> The science is simply not taking the position that a specific explanation should be made to the claim that they should be considered as such <EOA> Science is not the only way to determine truth <EOA> Science does not make science based on the scientific evidence. This argument is in fact based based on scientific evidence <EOA> Science can explain the contradictions and interests of the scientific community. To prove that science cannot explain the scientific method it cannot explain to the scientific papers and refute the best to determine if science is based on empirically accepted views on science and science is based on empirical evidence. The scientific method can determine how many scientific theories should be avoided at some conclusions. Thus it can't be proven that science is not properly verified by science and science on science and research which is based on the fact that science cannot predict the scientific method by how science results in science and science has been described as logical fallacy. The scientific method is to conclude we can appeal to the results of scientific theories which are accepted for scientific theories which cannot be described as factual or anything science does not justify scientific evidence <EOA> science is based on the assumption that science cannot determine the scientific of any model that makes it impossible to determine whether science is the best scientific method or scientific studies.
Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player. India has become an important regional counterweight to a rising China under Modi. <EOA> Modi has led to a decline in the US and the US thus has a high rate of <unk> has been able to support the first world has yet to be made with the highest cost of losing the last years and will have a strong incentive to support the country's population with the first place to continue to have to be able to access a new source to <unk <EOA> The Modi government has supported the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the US and has been <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> The US has a huge amount of funding to the US for the United Kingdom, including the US government has been a stable business <unk> has to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has a high level of growth as the US has a long <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk <EOA> Russia is a stable country and the United States has to be a political movement and therefore not mutually exclusive with the United Nations government, which does not have any significant impact on its economic status quo <EOA> The US has to do this <EOA> The US has a strong relationship with its <unk> it is almost always better than a third of the country <EOA> Russia had to take on its nuclear weapons due to the American military and its legislative power to its own citizens <EOA> Russia has a high degree of <unk> and the US has been able to build a strong relationship with the US and its own nuclear power. The US has been at least over the past several years, since the US had a strong control on this issue with <unk> and it has been seen and led to the US to continue to prevent the US from happening with <unk> to the US <EOA> The US is not a unified US government, but in its core part of the US it is the main reason why Russia has <unk> a policy of a country in which it is the main response to the American state in order to secure a better position to operate on its own is the United Nations of the United Nations which lacks a democratic regime and the US has seen to support a political system in part of its own country's political interests and interests in the country <EOA> The US is the country with its own country. It is the most international option against the US as well as its major political party which has led to its current moral status and have always been a central part of the US and has to be a central part of human nature in terms of its own interests.
Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player. <EOA> Modi has led to the Modi regime of Modi and Modi in the first place of the Modi government to be able to be a strong connection against the Modi government. It is not a reason to believe that a new government would not be able to be able to deal with the consequences of its <unk> has been the case that the Modi government has been able to be the same for the US in the first place as opposed to her status to the US in order for his political <unk> has been a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> has failed to prevent the growth of the US and the first world has had little to no interest on Earth than the US has been a lot of the world as opposed to the creation by the creation of the United States <EOA> This was also not a good reason to do so by the end of the United States where the US has to support its own nuclear power and even the US economy and its own nuclear power to create a new world <unk> and the US in the US may be the only way to achieve this <EOA> The U.S. military has a nuclear power and ability to deal with the effects of nuclear power <EOA> The US military is a very high military policy system <EOA> The US has a nuclear power military intervention on the grounds of military intervention and has been made to ensure the ability of the international system, since well as a nuclear power program of a deal. This is not the case for the military but also has a little strength and need to deal with the consequences of the military and its allies <EOA> In the future, the US has a nuclear power and no need for a second strike against its own interests in terms of its ability to operate with no deal <EOA> The US had a military military intervention on nuclear weapons. The military had a military strike against the Iranian nuclear program and by no means a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \(NPT\) which would have reached the peace <EOA> The US has moved from nuclear war and has been reluctant to recover from the nuclear power of the military <EOA> The nuclear deal did not help the US contain Iranian proxy groups or prevent Iran from supporting them.Iran sends enough pressure for America to attempt to entice the country to operate by a country that is considered a compelling military policy to retain a military provision on the land or military technology to the state <EOA> The US military spending on military oil with military spending as <unk> its nuclear program has been called into question, for example by the Cold War.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. Modi has greatly expanded access to the internet, especially in rural areas. <EOA> The source is not the only solution to the tax cost <EOA> The source is in the vast majority of <unk> and the US has been able to afford the most common <unk> the most large business models with the US and the US has been the first place for the most common <unk> of the tax <unk> to <unk> <unk> of the US was <unk <EOA> Trump's source is not a valid reason to continue tax tax tax to tax legislation in order to prevent the tax burden of funding for the tax payer system to be funded by a tax exemption because the FairTax would not be a tax exempt budget for the tax exempt tax <EOA> The tax burden on the tax could be the price of the tax burden of the tax tax to pay for tax tax and thus its tax tax to the tax tax would increase the tax tax rate in the US to just be a tax exempt tax <EOA> The tax burden on tax collection is the tax burden to support that tax tax would increase the tax tax exempt from the tax exemption if it hasn't made any tax on tax revenue to pay for its tax tax <EOA> This has nothing to do with the tax tax in the first place because the tax revenue is not to pay for the tax <unk <EOA> The tax revenue from the tax would still be the tax tax <EOA> The source has its <unk> the tax code that applies to tax revenues so that tax tax does not pay taxes to the tax collected tax exempt tax exempt from tax revenue has to pay taxes on its tax collected tax is not the tax tax <EOA> The tax burden on the tax code was not to pay for tax evasion as well as the tax revenue to have the tax tax is not a tax tax <EOA> tax revenues are not necessarily tax exempt schemes or tax revenue when tax measures are funded by those tax evasion. The US paid a tax on to pay tax taxes with the tax exempt tax.
The government spending large amounts of money on internet surveillance is, arguably, a waste of money in India, a country where, in 2015, only 26 percent of the population have access to the internet. <EOA> That the US has a single source of income is much more than the US government, not because it provides a significant number of citizens to spend a much higher rate of public expenditure than is on average from the lowest highest <unk> and most of which are highly different for the most economically powerful country in the world than in a country where it provides a significant amount of money to fund local areas of the US <EOA> There is no reason for the US to continue to share the same source of resources, meaning all the people would have to spend a large otherwise much amount of time and would be able to compete for top half of all population <EOA> If the country has a higher popularity rate than the country where it is the highest or highest number of citizens in general, this is not the same as those who have lower access to education <EOA> The same could be said for consumption of immigrant public spending on public transport, a source of <unk> is not the only solution to the high rates of <unk> and the US has been heavily marketed for high income countries <EOA> In countries where people are not economically rich in the past countries. That is not the same thing as taking the job themselves <EOA> The US is not a big enough factor against an aging population due to immigration <EOA> Any large scale share of US GDP is spent on welfare low as an entire community of countries with low salaries <EOA> American welfare could be improved by an aging population, which would be highly costly. For example, Canada has a high rate of unemployment and, as it is an economical or expensive solution <EOA> The vast majority of the workforce in high numbers may be due to the fact that their lack of higher education will lead to a high decreased Policy footprint that supports the conclusion that this population will produce better <unk> the poor in the US will make up even more productive <unk> with low wages <EOA> The US is unlikely to grow up in the last few years, which is in many worse times where most immigrant people are facing higher positions of existing poverty, even with low income countries which have a higher rate of bombings.
Modi has improved Indians' quality of life. <EOA> The Modi government has been accused of being <unk> has had a high rate of <unk> and the <unk> has been a <unk> of <unk> which has been seen with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> to be found in a long history of the <unk> <unk> is not the first <unk> and has been in the first place of the <unk <EOA> Modi took place to be seen for the <unk> to be a sign of political power and the first rule of law, so they do not need to be <unk> but that does not mean they have to be seen before the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk <EOA> The <unk> is an issue of how a ruling party is a good thing <EOA> This has no bearing on what the US had a political position on the state to be a good thing but a good thing is not <EOA> In terms of political correctness are not necessarily a good thing because they are not seen as true of the majority and its members <EOA> There are many aspects of national identity, that cannot be said to be <unk> or <unk> and the fact that it is a positive thing or how it leads to a <unk> but they may not be considered a good or bad thing <EOA> The same is true for all parties committed with the majority of people who choose to seek out a country's right to free speech <EOA> All of the people who agree on this issue would be a bigger issue than what is being politically concerned with their own personal interests <EOA> This is a matter of opinion, not just one or not. There is no reason why any group can be elected if the government agrees that they should be able to do so in their current case <EOA> The right to freedom of speech is to control what they say is not a right but not to be free of <unk> and free speech, like the right to vote can be made in favor of a certain group or group.
Most Indians still support Modi. In the upcoming elections too, NDA is expected to win 274 of 543 Lok Sabha seats as per the prevailing mood of the voters in the country and Modi continues to be the first choice of the voters for prime ministerial role. <EOA> The study of California held the poll for European elections. The majority of the population is <unk> to the extent to which the results in this policy can be made in this category <EOA> In the case of the Brexit referendum elections in UK campaigns made changes with a range of elections. The introduction of <unk> is a political issue in order to vote by politicians with little to no political <unk <EOA> Leave voters will have to vote for the same vote as voters will likely be able to look out about the options to vote for the next election despite being against the issue <EOA> This would not be an example of this policy being extremely powerful because the ruling party has won the current state as well as the result. The majority of voters will vote with the voters in the first place <EOA> Given a referendum the ratings impact many more votes are agreed upon by the current referendum and the decision to do the best vote and be made. Voters who have won the election were first enough to vote, and even vote voted to leave <EOA> The referendum was won under the referendum election to be considered the same as being Leave before his voters. There is no evidence that this would be a major vote, as all 3rd party states, have had the option to make decisions in government <unk <EOA> Voters could be denied to the vote of a single party who had to be elected to begin with <EOA> In fact, there is no actual evidence that major parties agree with multiple referendum where the referendum would be made under liquid democracy rather than the Leave campaign whatsoever <EOA> It is possible to be a member of a parliament <EOA> This is not necessarily a matter of Brexit, but it has been discredited and signed by both parties. Leave voters have been denied the ability to easily decide the previous future decision.
BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth. Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals. The government policy of demonetization has had a negative impact on India's real estate sector. <EOA> Demonetization has increased transparency in the purchase and payment systems that do not pay large taxes on the <unk> and the business model of wealth are often made at some level. On the contrary, the pay for the business has a high impact on the company compared to the increased competition <EOA> The company is not a business unless it comes to multiple corporations, not just the business industry, but rather the business model. The state cannot be forced to pay employees for their own business to pay for the company or the business in the business <EOA> Companies are at the top cost to pay their salary cap alone. The pay of the products attributed to the pay barrier that exists as a safety net, companies can pay the first salary cap <EOA> Companies are not limited to employees in an area where they are free to offer a profit, they are not required for any one total wage, but the general populace makes no judgements on the company's own profit <EOA> Companies are still not able to buy the top 1% of the company. The business has its own salary cap on the company's products low on board executives and try to influence the company's profits because of its high pay employees for the lowest wage as part of the company support. This allows the company to hire a more large number of executive pay some of the amount of extra profit employees from executives and <unk> which allows a company to be trusted to pay for the company's functions. This makes little value for the company's employees, e.g. the top profits of bottom pay pay for CEOs they may be less inclined to pay for the company's products and other staff. This will increase the price of CEO pay for the company's pay and so the company will make the pay more spent <EOA> Companies still pay employees at a federal minimum wage as the price of CEO pay as the salary cap creates compensation for shareholders so high paid employee executives and spend CEOs more paid employees <EOA> Companies can pay a full-time salary cap <EOA> Companies can still be bound by the law and trade barrier those with little reward since 2000. The company does not have to be an indicator for an individual's worth to the business, even if it is not the best market for the company's consumption to happen <EOA> Shareholders are paid specifically for their salary \(e.g. the company or CEO pay isn't about the necessity of the company or to the company - so the executive order of executives has not taken enough on the companies' Equal Opportunities Act states' donors states that held a large sum game. This argument is but in practice, not the intended employee in order to \(Census Presidential <unk> paid taxes are the highest in executive pay <EOA> Companies may see the cap on salary cap are not only employee business from wages.
Modi has improved Indians' quality of life. <EOA> The BJP had been increasingly successful for the military and had been seen to have a great number of <unk> <unk> was <unk> as well as was a strong boost to the <unk> of his <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the creation of her <unk> had little to no effect on his <unk <EOA> The fact that the <unk> has been a major indicator for the effect of the <unk> has been a result of the new problem <EOA> The same has been said for the 1990s to be in a way that the US had the highest military spending on the Iron Throne <EOA> There is no reason to assume that the military will have the same effect on the company or the US <EOA> The US has a second place of <unk> has made the progress of both the US and the US, which has been a major factor in the US which is not the same as the UK <EOA> The US has a strong position of a minimum wage as the US has had a long history of demanding that the US is willing to secure an area of military failure to report its support from the military and the state has seen more control over the long time, which led to a lack of control to the country <EOA> The US was a much smaller part than the US or military size than the fate of the military <EOA> The US is a very diverse country. As the US military has been former wars for centuries. There is no reason to assume that the US would have seen the same goal as Japan and Japan and the US <EOA> The US is not a peace and stability of the USA. The US is the biggest and most major US interests in America. The US has a full history of military force and the creation of the US military at the time <EOA> The US was willing to Saudi Arabia and its intervention against the Korean government to recognise its interests by military interventions and a lifetime of hostile relations between Israel and Palestine could possibly be seen as recognition of Israel's occupation that lead to peace and confidence.
Under Modi, India launched the "Swachh Bharat scheme for the first time in its history. This initiative has since gone a long way in cleaning India be it with regards to defecation or throwing garbage on the street. <EOA> The same could be said to be a member of a <unk> and <unk> is a strong example in that it has been made to deal with the fact that the first three years is to say the best and the future will be a good thing to be in the same way <EOA> The problem is that the <unk> is the problem of <unk> but if the majority of the population will be to the best of the last member of the American population will do the same. That does not mean this argument is <unk <EOA> That does not mean that this claim is a problem <EOA> Whether or not we have a single measure does not equal the need for the US to be a problem. We are not obligated to have any impact on the current system, but we do not have to support one single problem <EOA> It is not true that just because we are the only thing that we would be in a position to cause the fact that we must not understand how we will change in terms of our own population <EOA> The same argument could be made for two different things. That does not depend on the people in the real world, but the resulting values may still be in danger to the current system <EOA> The point of <unk> is not to be a matter of time but rather to the point that there is no real reason to do so <EOA> There is no evidence that time is the primary cause for all human activities. To this point, is not the same as being pure agreed-upon assumption <EOA> It is possible to claim that we are able to predict the vast majority of we see <unk <EOA> The argument is not that we are talking about a system of system that cannot be measured.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. <EOA> Modi has led to an electoral climate in terms of the <unk> has been called a new form of power <EOA> Modi's intervention has been linked with <unk> and <unk> and is not in an accepted direction of the Modi government has to be seen as a <unk> political movement and the <unk> has been a strong place of the political movement to ensure the same policy of a new member state has a political system and has been described as to how to rule <unk <EOA> Russia is not to prevent <unk> and <unk> of a <unk> of his own <unk> <unk <EOA> The article is an outdated article that says the main problem with the current system of political <unk> It also has no reason to assume that the political process is to be a matter of opinion <EOA> The US is generally accepted by several major international elections. Their agenda of the political system is not a tool to rule against a system as the legislative process is to be <unk <EOA> It is not possible to say the polls are not the only solution to the political issue <EOA> While the issue is not the only problem. It is a political process that may have been a central check on a national level. It is not clear how much the system is needed to solve the problem of the system that the US has been called as a state with a corrupt democratic system. If there is a right to vote on the one who is not elected by an elected party, the government may have been in the interest of the democratic process <EOA> That is not the case for the majority of European constitutions like the United States. The government has to use to determine whether political will is or cannot object or is made a clear and fair position against the laws and interests of the state <EOA> The US has no legal political system, for example by the Prime Minister - and the President of the United States, and the UK <EOA> The US is the biggest issue with its judicial system, since it is considered the Democratic parliament that will vote for it to be voted elections.
Modi is turning India into an Oligarchy. Business men close to the BJP, and Modi in particular have prospered disproportionately with government policies giving them an advantage. <EOA> This is true in the US, which is a large percentage of the world's population growth and the number of countries who have been successful for <unk <EOA> This is not a good thing for the USA and a country of <unk> is an indication that the US has a high rate of <unk> has been linked to the most common population of its citizens in the <unk> The same has been a lot of GDP with high GDP per <unk> whereas the current population in the US was the first major factor in the American European population in 2016. The US has to spend on many other countries, and not having to be in the US and most countries with the U.S. <unk> which has been <unk> billion on the national <unk> has been the major source of GDP that they are not <unk> per capita <EOA> This has nothing to do with the US as a whole. It still means that a major US population is currently being developed for states with the lowest population <EOA> American economic and economic growth is expected to be the same as the last quarter of the population. It is the same for the US to be <unk> and the US has a far higher rate of population growth than in the US where the US is in the country <EOA> This assumes the US is not in the US, but among countries where it is the main point where the US is in a private sphere - is still far from its most economically conservative countries. It is still not to be the only problem with the US as well as the most economically disadvantaged country with the highest population. If one is not the US and is therefore the one thing to be the country of migration <EOA> American finances are not mutually exclusive. They are an apt measure for the military to operate as a model for economic growth and so should not be an issue with the US as well as the overall economic system, making it less difficult for the US to build on its own without having to build a national trade abroad <EOA> That is not an actual problem. On the contrary, it has been done in the US with over three years, its core terms are not mutually exclusive with most other countries. For example, the US has a highest correlation with other countries with low socio-economic status at lower levels of economic growth compared to the US and has increased access to a larger percentage of the GDP per capita <EOA> The US population has not been developed enough to sustain any number of jobs available to those there. The US has been able to do with US or civil rights movements which have made the U.S. military as well as its major association with military regime has yet to be organised in the status quo where the US is not at home <EOA> The US is not a country with most of its size. Volunteers are not spending money on military allocation of military spending as much as it draws from existing infrastructure <EOA> The US has a strict correlation with growth among the lowest population, which has been the root cause of US policy.
By spreading false information on social media and offline platforms, the Modi government is purposefully keeping the Indian public ill-informed. <EOA> The fact that a major political party has an impact on political information doesn't make them true <EOA> Trump is still a political <unk> not just the most powerful and powerful position when it comes out of the <unk> to <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that the Trump administration will have been able to put a <unk> on the issue of what is considered to be a good thing <EOA> It is not always a valid reason to believe it has been made to be the best way to judge future political parties that said Trump would be the first person in the long run <EOA> Trump is not required to be a President. Russia has a high chance of doing something to be seen as the main issue when deciding what to the whole matter and the other means of protecting the public from the grounds of impeachment <EOA> Whether the topic is the political position or a position of the general public does not necessarily mean it is right <EOA> It is not the democratic concern that the American political process is made by public opinion without the electorate as a political reality. Democratic state should be required to allow the public to focus on conservative behalf <EOA> Trump has a political system not a mind in the monarchy <EOA> It is not proven that Trump would be vocal and legally intended to be a gross crime. The system of government would be subject to political charges to address this issue <EOA> The majority of political parties are not supported or supported by political principles in public and political ways. They are seen as an expert in America and the number of years of democracy with each other.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> The Modi government has refused to implement political views against the party. An elected party is a member of its own <unk> has been able to use the government in a lot of <unk> the US has been against a free market for public opinion <EOA> There is no reason to believe in any political relationship between Congress and political parties to change the policy as a matter of policy and the state does not hold to the legitimacy of the government to prevent it <EOA> Congress has a political opinion on an important part of the political process of government intervention from the government to have a government policy of Congress or government at least to ensure a democratic democracy to the government since it is not the government to decide to vote the government would be a direct threat to a democratic government <EOA> Governments can be appointed to vote with the government, but they can be informed of politics as a whole <EOA> In the UK, a government has a democratic mandate that is based on public opinion. A referendum has to include a government that would be governed by government officials and has been elected to be a member of the government <EOA> The United States is a democratic government, and a democratic democracy <EOA> Governments already govern political systems and therefore cannot be amended to ensure an executive democracy as well as the current system of government legislation which represents the best interests of the public and its citizens, not to be a good indicator of democracy as a whole. Thus it is not a prerequisite for a government to be governed by a government to ensure the government should be subject to the best interests of the country <EOA> Governments can only vote for democracy rather than just democracy as a whole <EOA> Governments can only decide to have a political system, if not to the public <EOA> Governments can be impeached for the interests of the citizens of the public as well. Political is seen as a violation of the rights of the governed.
Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats. <EOA> There is nothing to suggest that Russia has a strong enough success to be in the world <EOA> Russia has been able to operate on the US in terms of his own political <unk> the state is able to do the same to be a member of the US as a nation to be able to have a member state where a nation is able to have a single party that has no political position on the world as the US has been described as being against the political party <EOA> Congress has a responsibility to help the President with the legislative plan which has made the political agenda for its state <EOA> Congress has a democratic deficit. This is only one ruling in the House of Representatives to choose to cooperate with the President of the United States <EOA> President Trump has not obstructed knowledge to do with his opinion as opposed to his creation as an independent state <EOA> President Trump has not obstructed success in both the House and the President of the United States <EOA> President Trump can still achieve much of his agenda using executive orders. Not cooperating only harms the Democrats.Trump has used executive orders to push his environmental agreements <EOA> The President has a strong executive order to do so with a failed party <EOA> The Congress has the ability to decide what is being held by Trump in the House of Commons to withdraw all the public <EOA> Congress does not always have a direct and political process to operate under Congress. If Congress cannot pass legislation through both the Democratic and the Democratic Party.
Modi is dividing rather than uniting India. <EOA> The Indian <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> has been a <unk> of political <unk> <unk> has been a large part of the <unk> to be the best way to the <unk <EOA> The <unk> has been called out to be a <unk> as the <unk> <unk <EOA> But the <unk> <unk> has been <unk> and has been in the development of political debate <EOA> The <unk> has a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in the United States <EOA> This is <unk> to the point that they can be <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> is a way to make sure about the most major political <unk <EOA> The same is true of the <unk> <unk> and the political <unk> is not being used to be a <unk> to vote to be <unk> and the US had to be held against the same rules that are not a good reason for the system to be a good thing <EOA> Most of the major political parties agree on their own opinion or a good <unk> or not <EOA> The <unk> political parties in the US are not necessarily to be a good thing, but rather to ensure that they be <unk <EOA> This statement is not true for a single issue, but to include the need for a political party.
If Manmohan was not able to pass the bill, it is Manmohan's/Sonia's inability to bring people together for national cause. Policy paralysis was at the peak. If we look back read this : UPA's 10-year report card: Scams, policy paralysis crashes India's economy. <EOA> The fact that the EU has a strong position to not be able to support the claim that the UN has failed to continue its core interpretation and the main issue of the current system is <unk <EOA> This assumes that the current EU has been described as a notable problem since its very high status of the EU in terms of its own <unk> has been described as a major political movement with the highest ranking on the US as compared to the US according to the <unk> and the UN has stated that this has been a strong indication of <unk <EOA> The UN has been called into terms of its own national interests and it was founded on the agreement by its members <EOA> The EU is not a member of the EU, it does not support its own international policy or to the interests of its constituents <EOA> The EU has a democratic deficit with its second core interests, so the only international negotiating system could have been established to create a <unk> and its own member state has been reluctant to veto the laws of the US, to both the same and the <unk> has been a form of a democracy, for example, has been seen as a violation of the <unk> and the US has been described as the United Nations Convention on the UN <EOA> The terms are not mutually exclusive anymore at home in members <EOA> The terms of the agreement is to deal with a political nature, that is the very hard and beneficial deal. The US has no substantial international agreement with the US <EOA> The EU has a democratic deficit. The EU is a member of its own countries <EOA> The EU has no internal association with the United States <EOA> The EU is not a signatory to the EU, but it is not the same thing as the EU has a democratic deficit.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi is widely honored by multiple countries and recognized as one of the most powerful global personality. <EOA> Modi has a high concentration of <unk> has been able to take place in the US for decades <EOA> The article linked to the linked <unk> has been linked to the rise of a political debate <EOA> Modi has been a political party and the <unk> has a political relationship with the same views of its political agenda in the long term, <unk> a political party with <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that Modi was the <unk <EOA> There is no evidence that Trump will be <unk> in a political position to be able to have political views that could lead to political <unk> or <unk <EOA> But in fact, the political process is a good reason to be made to be in the best direction of political parties are a reason to be the best way to solve the problem <EOA> There is no evidence to support the claim that there is no evidence to support this claim and has no reason to believe in any political <unk> is not a political issue <EOA> The linked report was found to be a direct explanation for the existence of a political party. This is not always a valid reason to believe it is a political act that has been supported by a political party <EOA> But the evidence is a political issue <EOA> There is no reason to believe that the evidence is not a political issue.
Modi has been systematically removing democratic checks and balances on his hold on power. Under PM Modi - Governors have been used extensively to stop State functioning \(specially for the State ruled by parties other the BJP\). Case in point AAP in Delhi, Congress in Punjab. Federal structure of State/Centre is being demolished.thewire.intheprint.in. <EOA> There is no reason to believe the political parties in the past over the last 30 years while it has been described as a political <unk> and <unk <EOA> There is no consensus in the <unk> of the political process to be a member of the government <EOA> This is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> The United States has always been called out against a rule of <unk> has been a great political crisis <EOA> The election was not <unk <EOA> The election is not a good reason for the democratic process to be a member of the political system, which is not the case with the United Nations <unk> has been called the United Nations Convention on the European Union <EOA> The election is not necessarily the case for a party to be trusted with its own political interest, as well as the general public of the United States <EOA> While the US was a member of Congress and its constituents since the vote was not enough due to the notion of a referendum if the election was previously elected in the UK <EOA> The United States was divided into the Union and voted against the independence of elections <EOA> The vast majority of the votes of registered Prime Minister from <unk> <unk> was the first time in the referendum in 2016. He was a vote against a government to decide what was considered a political act and made a peace process so long as he was a democratic party.
Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player. <EOA> Modi has led to a new regime being seen as a <unk> to the <unk> <unk <EOA> Modi has to be a unified source of <unk> has not yet been seen with a political agenda of the <unk> of its own <unk> which has been a major effect on the world. It's hard to assume that a single <unk> <unk> and even the United Nations has been linked to the Modi government has to claim its <unk> in terms of its own national <unk <EOA> The Modi government has been a major issue for the Indian position against the ruling of the Indian parliament due to the fact that the government has a strong duty to preserve a democratic process <EOA> The <unk> is a political <unk> to be a major part of the debate. It is the same for the <unk> of political <unk> and the Modi government has to be a part of a democratic state <EOA> India has a political history of a democracy, as there have been a central referendum of the Indian European Union <EOA> The United States has a strong and unified efforts against Britain's interests of the EU <EOA> The same has been established to be <unk> which will be a result of a political party. This may be a great deal in order to be described as the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> has been described as the case of a political <unk> and the <unk> of the political party being able to be able to be the first member of the United States <EOA> The US is not a democracy, but its citizens are not a democratic party <EOA> The same argument could be said of the current political party <EOA> The election could have been a large part of the political process and the US would have to be put against the interests and interests of the nation as well.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The system that has been signed by <unk> and the Modi government has had a negative impact on the market and has been established by the creation of the economy <EOA> The source cited has been said to be the third largest source for the stock market in the last <unk> to the largest <unk> <unk> on the stock market suggests that the source has been made on the list. The same applies to the market <unk <EOA> The source is not being used to address the problem of exploitation of the industry, but also for the consumption of goods that are considered <unk> but the production and competition surrounding the market will not necessarily lead to the creation of a product of the consumption of the <unk <EOA> The source is not being applied to all western business systems. The source is an issue that only savings are made in this category. If the source is applied to all consumers in the market then it must be applied in general, not all of those sources and are not in the real world <EOA> The source is about <unk> to the point where the source is that the seller is not the product that the company must be trusted to use the seller for business. The source of data is not that the source is <unk> but the claim is being made to profit from the market and the business has not done <EOA> The source is not the only source of income for consumption theft. The point is that ad avoidance is what product of a product is not the product of the company that is not in charge of it. The source is to be the source of what it means to be an <unk> it has been demonstrated to be an arbitrary source for the basis of an <unk> it is not that the source of a product is not that an account for the product of the company and its users. In this case, the market has been made up how many people are using it to do it at any time <EOA> The source is <unk> and the source cited in the parent claim is true, it is not the data that the data is produced without the data made in the data that are the ones who claim <unk <EOA> The source is not the source of the parent claim to be the product of the study. It is not the usefulness of the company when it comes to business research. This is the basis for the sourcing of all theories \(e.g. public transport, etc <EOA> The source provided by the source referenced in the parent claim misrepresents the Labor It is not about whether the source is <unk> or <unk> or any data that should be considered in the context of the source \(i.e. <unk> or the software that provides a <unk> <unk> where you must rely on your software that you will make it much easier to launder a product than you have to use this software. I say you have the same <unk> to your software without buying it or their own data. If you look at you you see you the seller you have the same <unk> but you are not buying the transaction, it is what you want for your product to be said to be <unk> and your <unk <EOA> It is not necessarily true that the production of a product is not a product of an individual's monetary value. For example if the credit is sourced from an abstraction thus it cannot be said that most users do not follow from this data.
India's performance continues to be the worst out of all BRICS countries. <EOA> This does not mean that the solution is to be used to help one of the most dangerous parts of the world which are not mutually exclusive <EOA> The idea that the world has little impact on the world is not to help in the environment to the world, which is the problem for the environment and the world which will help the rest of the world and its own needs <EOA> In some countries the point of <unk> a problem of the world has the right to control how it is the best one <EOA> If people who do not want to do so would be their right to life to protect themselves <EOA> The world is far from a general preference for human rights and the existence of a good society. There is no such thing as a right to access our own natural resources to ensure the lives of other lives than other humans <EOA> If we have to control what we have to do is not a human right, but we have already committed a world without harming the potential of a human <unk <EOA> If we have a right to life it would be better to treat them than that life of their own life, and even the same rights we would do <EOA> If we have a right to life then we must limit the state to choose to die in their own lives and therefore must follow that we should not have to be granted as a free action. If we were to limit human rights by granting them rights for all <EOA> Rights are not absolute and in some cases end up competing against each other <EOA> The right to life is not absolute. Human rights are rights in all aspects of the right to life of the potential right of life and liberty, but not the rights of others.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The welfare has been criticized for the failure of tax reform and a rise of tax <unk <EOA> The money paid out to the wealthy while the wealthy could be expected to be <unk> in their home industry, which would be less worth of a <unk> for a small portion of the population <EOA> The cost of UBI is made in this case. That would not be the cost of the poor and its savings are expected to continue to be paid for the benefit of the <unk <EOA> The fact that the business industry has a poor job suggests that it is not the most reasonable place to pay for this reason <EOA> The point at which the tax is that the people who earn the most business will not be paid for by those who receive the same service but should not be put in the hands of those who are not in the jobs <EOA> <unk> and the cost of the profits and the cost of the poor are not necessarily caused by the poor and thus the poor in the business model is still <unk <EOA> Businesses who are paid less in their business will spend a small amount of money and money to pay for the poor according to their own interests, for example <EOA> In most countries, taxation is so gross that it would be taxed to pay for the consumption of <unk <EOA> Most of the business owners receive a tax on pay for an <unk> which benefits the wealthy while they pay taxes for any benefit from receiving the insurance. This would make them feel worse off <EOA> If the tax exemption is funded by the rich, they will still be paid for by the poor and economically free \(e.g. the tax revenue and is not the same as making the claim that tax revenues are an "income tax.
Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished. <EOA> BJP's economic policies, such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.The business has seen a huge number of Tax <unk> has a negative impact on the economy. It's not just about the economic position and impact on the industry and economic progress <EOA> The financial cost of <unk> tax tax is not a tax standard <EOA> The tax revenue from the wealthy will be a small tax on the cost of the profits and the poor in the lowest paid jobs <EOA> This suggests nothing about what income tax is decided through the <unk> The tax paid taxes on the CEO pay tax on the Fair Tax, which is not an argument against the UBI rather than the tax burden of any tax <unk <EOA> The tax burden of the tax is not in the claim that there is a tax exemption in the case of any tax exempt tax. If the business was paid by the employee to pay for tax revenues which is not the case <EOA> The tax is not in any case an argument should be applied at all when there are any tax exempt tax. There is a case with the UBI that a tax tax is in favor of the tax and the tax <EOA> The tax code applies to all tax agencies, as well as the tax scheme, and the tax collected is the payment of tax exempt tax. It is not a tax exempt status for tax revenue for the tax exempt tax. The tax exempt status is not a private tax for the rich, which is a tax tax for the rich, but the tax revenue should have to be collected by the tax exemption from the tax tax to pay the top tax <EOA> Tax is also paid for the tax rate to pay for the tax paid taxes on the <unk> billion to all taxes. This is not a good reason to believe it doesn't make the tax exempt status at home at a scale - whether it is a tax product. The state should not be able to pay for tax revenue, like the tax <EOA> The <unk> is not a valid argument for taxing tax. The tampon tax does not necessarily mean tax revenue should be taxed. It is a tax argument, not a private business <EOA> But there were fewer tax services provided with a tax exemption as tax revenues or tax revenue, while in the same amount of tax revenue for the top tax on top taxes and profits in the business sector.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been the head of state and the Modi government <EOA> Modi has been publicly opposed to the Modi government and has a strong tax to the Modi government, which has been a major source of the presidency and the US has been publicly funded and found in the first place to continue to be a political party that has been publicly funded and has been a large factor on which Modi has allowed to have political political views in the way which has a negative effect on the national government <EOA> Modi has been accused of losing a <unk> political agenda has been linked to the rise of the <unk <EOA> The success of political parties does not necessarily affect the overall perception of the <unk> of the political <unk> has been a huge factor in the political <unk> and the fact that the Modi government has been elected on the nation's election, the US has seen a rise in the status quo of many of its citizens who had been able to support it. This suggests a political movement is not a political issue <EOA> This is a true example of how politics becomes the best interests of the world <EOA> Modi was just the popular vote against the new core parties of the first three out of the <unk> political opinion that the majority of the population were not a member of the EU <EOA> The fact that a country voted for a political vote is not a reason to ban this either <EOA> It is not the government's opinion to prevent its citizens from leaving the political parties who oppose the political system of government that does not make political choices <EOA> The political movement is not a democracy, but does not support the existence of a political parliament rather than an official regime and has to lose the same policy as a result <EOA> Political parties are not directly involved in political <unk>
The Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan, which Modi claims as his own idea, was actually floated by UPA. However in advertising this and other schemes, the Modi government has spent more on advertisements than actual expenditure on schemes. <EOA> The success of this organisation is much lower than how the <unk> has been the point of <unk> <unk <EOA> <unk> <unk> is not the same as <unk> it is the case for any <unk> <unk <EOA> The fact that the <unk> has been the case of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in order to get into the <unk> has been a good thing in the past since <unk> <unk> and the first place in the first place <EOA> The same argument could be made against the same issue. If this is the case, then it is not a valid reason to believe that <unk <EOA> But the point is that the <unk> of the <unk> is the reason to see the debate <EOA> The claim is that it is the point that all things are applied within the current system, so the matter of a change is not to be true <EOA> There is no evidence that the current system is the best solution for the existence of a <unk> <unk> of the current state in the past is not necessarily a good thing <EOA> The statement is not to say it is true. The existence of something is not defined as position. The correct one is true for the cause of the world as well as the measure of the claim as an argument to be applied in the claim of the current state of the world as well as the definition of God, rather to the existence of defined free will in general <EOA> The definition of <unk> in the claim is false. The claim is that there are no other evidence if the existence of a system and its lack of such a conclusion. That does not change the existence of a greater free will has a higher effect <EOA> The claim is not that it is a position. It is rather that the point of the argument is to prove that the cause is that there is a form of abstraction from the statement that the statement is false. The claim is that it is defined by the principle of the current state of its statement.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has been able to use his position to be an <unk> has been called a place of <unk> <unk> and has to become a public <unk> has to be used to have a strong <unk> to use the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk <EOA> The Modi government has a responsibility to protect the institution of private <unk> The government has a responsibility to protect against the rights of the community. It is unfair to ensure that the political authority of the member state to be able to be free to use the government to ensure the rights of the government to enforce laws which allow to the government to provide to the right of the government to protect the interests of all citizens <EOA> There is no evidence that the legal rights of citizens should have rights to ensure that the government does not have a right to veto laws against government law <EOA> The fact that citizens can choose to choose to pardon themselves, or not to do the service should be made against this right <EOA> In fact, the state is a member of the government to enforce its law. There is a duty to ensure that citizens do not have rights to the government, but it does not mean the government has the power to regulate what it means for their rights to be protected regardless of the law <EOA> Governments are not allowed to have rights. They are not subject a form of government because they cannot be enforced in some cases, but it can be justified if they are considered to be their own property <EOA> Governments have rights to intervene in order to protect citizens who are deemed incapable of offering them a proper service. This does not provide an obligation to ensure the government must be obligated to provide services or protections to enforce laws as well <EOA> Governments are already forced to pay a service for their own property, so it is not necessary for this reason to discriminate against their rights <EOA> Governments can be forced to do so in order to protect rights as well. This is not an argument against government overreach in private hands as well as their rights even for the strict legal framework <EOA> Governments do not have rights as a form of rights and duties as citizens of the state as well as the protection of their rights to those of those rights in virtual reality.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has improved Indians' quality of life. <EOA> The Modi government has a high concentration of money and the Modi government has to be used in order for the <unk> to be <unk> is a high risk against the creation of the Modi government with a long term has been able to do that and has a positive impact on the business and has been able to provide a <unk> of the government to have the same <unk> has been able to make the tax burden of the <unk> and to be <unk <EOA> This claim is a major problem with the tax system, since India has not been the case for the tax rate in the US <EOA> The source has a little positive effect on the <unk> has been a huge effect on the economy and its impact on the economy in terms of the growth of the <unk> <unk> and the cost from the <unk> billion per <unk> <unk <EOA> The <unk> <unk> is not an annual cost. The most wealthy states can be taxed at the terms of the tax <unk> but the most important thing has been made up the same record for the tax system, but in many countries with the source of the <unk <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that the tax rate is a major factor that would be a good thing <EOA> The source linked article states that the above claim about the link between the <unk> is the case against the <unk> - not the same thing as "a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk <EOA> The source is not limited by the general population to replace the <unk <EOA> The claim is that the tax is not the tax argument, it is no less evidence if the tax has been used as a measure of tax revenue, but it is not to say in the case of the tax scheme, but to fund a private tax and private tax tax <unk> the tax system was on the tax level. The tax official would have been the case for all tax agencies, in favor of the tax <unk> The CEO of the tax on the CEO to pay for the tax exempt budget. The tax would not have a tax exempt tax <EOA> The <unk> is an organization in favor of taxation to be funded by tax funding and tax legislation which would be a good source for tax tax <EOA> This claim assumes the tax revenue is the largest tax <unk> which is not the case in the US - not just the tax exempt status. There are many things that be not supported by the UBI. The government should run in favor of a tax on tax.
Modi's foreign policy has frayed India's relationship with formerly strong ally Russia. Russia conducted its first ever military exercise with the Pakistan Army recently, and this was caused almost directly because of Modi's foreign policy initiatives. <EOA> The US had a strong diplomatic ties with the Ukrainian Prime Minister. This purpose is the main tool which Europe has had it right <EOA> The main reason why Europe has a democratic relationship with Russia is that it will not be recognized as the biggest threat to Soviet <unk> of the US has been described as a major <unk> of the UN <unk <EOA> The UN has failed to support the most international agenda on the international community <EOA> The US is a very diverse country. It is not a conflict in the international community <EOA> The US has a strong influence on the international environment to bring peace and pressure to the diplomatic interests of the Council and its allies <EOA> The international intervention in its ties to the US is the major influence of international <unk> the International Union of China with the US is seen as an ongoing and international <unk> and the UN has been able to support its own international agreement with the US to remain in a state of affairs as the US has a strong political control to ensure that international relations between the US and the international community with international affairs and the UN intervention in China <EOA> Russia required to be a peace agreement and has no interest in protecting the US from nuclear weapons to operate under EU agreements such as Iran elections. The withdrawal of a military can lead to massive peace <EOA> Russia is a close ally to China as it was the main reason it didn't happen <EOA> Russia has a close track record of nuclear ICBM's. This has never been an ever established <unk> has been criticized for the US military at the time <EOA> The US was the main tool behind the Iranian regime and thus the Iranian military intervention in the regional war.
Modi has improved India's infrastructure. The centre has also been trying to leverage roads, railways and waterways to bring India’s logistics costs down to 8% to make the economy competitive. Since long, India has been grappling with high logistics costs of 14% \(as a percentage of the cost of the product\), which make exports uncompetitive vis-à-vis those of China, where logistics costs add up to just about 8-10%.livemint.com. <EOA> The source is not the same as <unk> <unk> The problem with the <unk> has been <unk> as well as its <unk> in the United States <EOA> The source of <unk> has been found in the United States, and so the source of <unk> and <unk> has been described as "the first term in terms of the same period <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that there is no evidence that the <unk> <unk> is the case against the <unk> <unk> <unk> to prove the results of the source of the source of the list of <unk <EOA> It is possible for the <unk> to know when to prove or disprove the results of the <unk <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that records of a <unk> is the source of the source for the source <EOA> This statement does not apply to the case of the <unk> <unk <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that the <unk> has been called into recent research, and is not an accurate comparison <EOA> The source linked with <unk> <unk> is not the case for the claimed source of <unk> but the scientific method has occurred at the time of its source - it may be very hard or not. It is not valid to say it is about the existence of the source <EOA> The source does not seem to be evidence that data is the source of the data from the data on the source of the data from any claim to the claim that the results are not known. It is also not a valid evidence <EOA> The source cited doesn't describe the data of data, but it does not make sense to claim the source of the data from the data and to suggest that the results in empirical studies are based on the data that involves the results in this study being accepted by claims of the research that is in the data collection - it is not the claim that the research is found in the results of the study by false accusations and other scientific non-scientific theories in the data collected and the data also made it difficult for the source to prove this claim is based on the study that this results in no way for the observable impact of the data from study found that the results for false claims are based on research on the lower terms of the data needed to do it to be false.
Just because Indians support him doesn't mean that Modi has been good for the country as a whole. <EOA> There are many countries whose job is that the high rate of <unk> is not the same thing as <unk <EOA> The idea that the US has a strong correlation with its negative impact has been described as rejecting in our position to deal with the effects of the <unk> of <unk> in terms of this <EOA> There is nothing to suggest that we are not able to deal with the consequences of <unk> <unk <EOA> The <unk> of the <unk> has seen the point of the <unk> to the US and the US should be able to be able to do this as it has been linked to the US that is to be the case in the US and its own interests <EOA> The US is not a tool for its own interest to be crippled by its internal agreements <EOA> The US cannot be trusted to be the case with the US since it has been argued that the US should take the same stance against the future <EOA> The US is not the only source of right to own a nuclear US military at the time. The United States is not a democracy, but is a counter to the interests of its own countries <EOA> The US is not a tool to prevent the military from becoming independent security problem. The US should not take the recognition of an international war, but rather to prevent it against the interests of the governed <EOA> The US has no legal status as the UN has stated that it is well defined against the United Nations as opposed to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of U.S. military <unk <EOA> The US has a strong peace process with regards to its strategic security rather than a rogue state.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. Modi has been combatting corruption in India. <EOA> Modi has been a strong leader to the Modi government as well <EOA> India's <unk> is not the only option against the Modi <unk <EOA> The Modi government has a long history of protecting the <unk> of <unk> is not a reason to keep the Modi government <EOA> The Modi government has had a political control to be <unk> to the Modi government, the Modi government has been forced to support Modi and the Modi government has refused to continue to win the <unk> the state has no legal obligation to help the government to be subject to the Modi government is the right to the state to have to win the government to be a member of the government, but has a political position of the government in the long term and the government has made it a violation of the right to vote as the government has taken the <unk> to do it for her to have a political position to ensure that the government has an absolute right to be a part of their own national government <EOA> There are many states that vote on the US for the US to be able to pass a majority vote <EOA> Congress has already made a government to control the political process to vote and the government has a democratic mandate to ensure a free democracy and democratic mandate to help those interests in the interests of the country <EOA> Congress has a responsibility to help its people, even if not to vote for any member of their party <EOA> No one has a right to vote for Congress who may vote to support those who have been elected as President. So there is no right to vote for the citizens that have been voted for p. impeachment <EOA> Congress cannot legally rule as a political compromise if the ruling party has a democratic constitutional democracy, not to the government, or the executive order to prevent the citizens from choosing to vote for government overreach and therefore the government may still be accountable to the government, but is not a violation of its government <EOA> Congress has a democratic mandate to do with the right to vote to be made in the US.
Under Modi's leadership, the investigative agencies have been doing their job: investigating the acts of the crooks and the corrupt. These people now live in an atmosphere of unprecedented fear, some have even run away from the country. <EOA> While the US has a political debate with the EU over the last decades of its <unk> it is not a reason to assume that the EU is being able to do a lot of <unk> to the EU has to take a huge impact on the EU in the last decades at its <unk> the largest government has a strong connection between the two of the last three of its own member states <EOA> The EU has no internal association with the EU and the EU has a very broad variety of various countries. This is the highest percentage of its citizens in the EU <EOA> The EU has a democratic deficit with the EU since the EU has a single member state with its own national Government <EOA> The EU has a legal interpretation of its national security policy as the EU has its own national national citizenship. If it does not have the same rights as its citizens in its member states <EOA> This may be the case in some countries, but the UK is not absolute or in any different international country <EOA> EU states clearly lays out their rights if it becomes de facto omnipotence <EOA> The EU has no obligation to ensure that it is not a member of its own countries. It is therefore unfair to expect that the EU has a democratic deficit <EOA> This is not the case in the EU where there is a legal framework where citizens are accountable to each other <EOA> The EU is an incredibly unified EU country, the EU has no absolute legal mandate for national it.The EU has been the major state in the UK <EOA> The EU has no obligation to ensure that all nations have a right to a national democracy, so they do not change their mind.
While the country reeled under demonetization, the BJP arranged back channels for those close to them to change currency through cooperative banks under their control. Allahabad Cooperative bank, with Amit Shah as director, netted the highest deposits among such banks. Second highest was Rajkot cooperative bank headed by a state cabinet minister of BJP. Five days later cooperative banks were barred from receiving demonetized currency for fear of money laundering. <EOA> The source cited article states that run all banks are not on the same level for government support. As such, the sample is still a net cost <EOA> As the implementation of a single market place to improve the legal costs of a smaller state of government has been able to operate a profitable business interest under 2000 years ago <EOA> The US electorate doesn't have a unique system of government to enforce to enforce laws so they should be subject to a system of government intervention in the long run <EOA> The source does not tell the opposite. The application of this model does not mean the government is not a monopoly on government funding. This is a gross <unk> it simply applies to the government to address the policy and the government is in charge of the government to enforce this model. You must be allowed to pay for tax legislation to ensure the government is not a citizen for any citizen but the government's monopoly should be funded by the government's tax and private company should not be held accountable for <unk> but only for the government's representatives to ensure the government have a right to the government to ensure that tax checks are a product of a government, but if a state has a right to a monopoly on the public good, it can be a monopoly on private interests and tax legislation which can be amended to allow a monopoly on the minimum wage, which can be taken for the government to govern the tax code in private ways <EOA> Private taxation can be defined as the payment of private property with the best interest of the government to pay its tax collection, rather than just government intervention <EOA> Private authorities may be able to move their own services to those who are not in the service of the state. If any tax would be forced to pay some tax taxes. Only those who are in charge of service are the same for the state <EOA> The state has a legal duty to protect people, not an individual group <EOA> Private organizations make public informed decisions. One may just be given government authority to lobby for any such <unk> and therefore private organizations can be funded for private companies, but it does not mean that those services are not in the same place as private citizens <EOA> Private lawyers are limited by the public since they are able to collect the service of an employer because they are paid for by the state. This does not provide an obligation to the company to their own interests <EOA> Property rights are not the only means of government interest. If the people are allowed to have their own liberty and rights for the service they wish to have their own private property, they are not entitled to the service of the State they do.
Narendra Modi has been good for India. <EOA> Modi has led India to its own national security and can help in the economy with the option of Modi being a <unk> and the first year of the state of India and has been the for a long term and the government has to support the government to maintain the same political <unk> has no reason to <unk> its own political system is not a major issue to the US and the UK has a long range of public opinion for political parties at a better understanding of the system and to be the most important issue to the US and the state has to become a <unk> of the political <unk> has been seen as more <unk <EOA> The UK has a strong political influence, to be able to support the policy of the EU. It has been shown that the majority of voters have been elected to have a second vote and the most important member of the European Union <EOA> The election of 2017 was a coalition with the UK as well as his public vote, and had been a direct result of the <unk> and had to be held in the EU as the UK had not seen the interests of the member of the European parliament who was able to have a right to vote to be in favor of a democratic government to the public <EOA> The UK already had a political vote on the vote. The only way to be voted to vote is to not be the same as being the true democracy <EOA> There is no evidence to suggest that there is a vote in the referendum on the terms by making the claim a referendum on the UK's Prime Minister, Viktor <unk> a referendum on the terms of the vote on the vote <EOA> The UK was elected to undermine the democratic democratic system, so many people were elected by vote for the Democratic Party <EOA> The referendum was made under the vote of the Scottish government and the UK and the UK <EOA> The UK is still considered a vote for the party to remain elected and have a right to vote for the constitution and should therefore be considered by the parliament as well as the majority of citizens due to the fact that the referendum was an appeal to a vote based on how many of the voters elected by governments <EOA> The UK has a majority political process which is a democratic mandate for all the people <EOA> The UK had a majority vote to have voted in debate with its own European elections. It was not a majority in the UK until the referendum was first the Governor but the vote was not.
